[![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FPlaybooks%2FAS-Blob-Storage-Add-Domains-to-Zscaler-URL-Category%2Fazuredeploy.json)    

This playbook will use an Azure blob storage file to maintain a Zscaler custom URL category of your choice. The logic app is set to run every 5 minutes polling this blob storage file for changes. If any changes are made to the blob storage file, the Zscaler URL category values will be updated to match the file exactly. This will enable you to manage your Zscaler custom URL categories entirely from Microsoft Sentinel.
Blob storage was opted for because unlike Microsoft Sentinel watchlists, the lastModified time attribute reflects changes to the contents of the file.

# 
### Setup


#### Zscaler Root Domain

Navigate to https://www.zscaler.com/ and expand the dropdown list under "**Sign In**". The value you enter for the "**Zscaler Root Domain**" deployment parameter should exactly match the format of the options shown here. Select your appropriate domain and log in.

![Zscaler_Root_Domain_1](Images/Zscaler_Root_Domain_1.png)


#### Zscaler Admin Account:

After logging into your account, you will need to configure your Zscaler API roles and API admin account.  

For this Playbook to modify your Zscaler custom domain list, you will need a local Zscaler admin account that has access to the read and modify policy. To limit the access this account has to only what is needed, you will need to make a custom administrator role. 

In the Zscaler administration console hover over **Administration then click on Role Management**.

![Zscaler_Admin_Account_1](Images/Zscaler_Admin_Account_1.png)

Click on **Add Administrator Role**.

![Zscaler_Admin_Account_2](Images/Zscaler_Admin_Account_2.png)

Create a **Name** for the **Administrator Role** and use the settings **exactly** as depicted in the image below. Then click the **Save** button.

![Zscaler_Admin_Account_3](Images/Zscaler_Admin_Account_3.png)

Hover over the **Activation** button and click **Activate** to enable the new Role.

![Zscaler_Admin_Account_4](Images/Zscaler_Admin_Account_4.png)

Next, hover over **Administration** and click on **Administrator Management**.

![Zscaler_Admin_Account_5](Images/Zscaler_Admin_Account_5.png)

Click on **Add Administrator**.

![Zscaler_Admin_Account_6](Images/Zscaler_Admin_Account_6.png)

Enter a **Login ID** for the API administrator account you want to create. 

In the **Email** box you can enter a preexisting service account, or simply make up an email address which you will not use in your domain. There is no need for email access for this account.

Enter a name for the account and in the drop-down box below, select the Role you created in the previous step.

Make sure **Password Based Login** is checked and create a secure password for this API account.

Take note of the email address and password, as it will be needed during deployment.

![Zscaler_Admin_Account_7](Images/Zscaler_Admin_Account_7.png)

Click **Save**, then hover over the **Activation** button and click **Activate**. This will enable the new administrator account.

![Zscaler_Admin_Account_8](Images/Zscaler_Admin_Account_8.png)


#### Zscaler API Key:

To get your **API key** hover over the **Administration** button and click on **API Key Management**.

![Zscaler_API_Key_1](Images/Zscaler_API_Key_1.png)

Here you will find you **API Key** as well as **Zscaler Instance Name.** You will need both of these when deploying this playbook. The typical instance names are Zscaler, ZscalerOne, ZscalerTwo, ZscalerThree, and ZsCloud.

![Zscaler_API_Key_2](Images/Zscaler_API_Key_2.png)


#### Zscaler URL Category:

Lastly, you will need to note the custom URL category you want the domains from Microsoft Sentinel incidents added to. 

Hover over the **Administration** button and click on **URL Categories.** 

Take note of the name of your desired URL category, as it will be needed during deployment. 

![Zscaler_URL_Category_1](Images/Zscaler_URL_Category_1.png)

In the example below we use name of our Custom category AS_Blocklist. 
This category in our test environment configured to a Zscaler access policy that disallows users access to any domain in in that list.

![Zscaler_URL_Category_2](Images/Zscaler_URL_Category_2.png)


#### Create Azure Key Vault Secrets:

You will need to add you Zscaler API key and Zscaler password to an Azure key vault.

Navigate to the Azure key vaults page: https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.KeyVault%2Fvaults

Select an existing key vault or create a new one. From the key vault overview page, click the "**Secrets**" menu option on the key vault page menu. Click "**Generate/Import**".

![Zscaler_Key_Vault_1](Images/Zscaler_Key_Vault_1.png)

Choose a name for the secret, such as "**AS-Blob-Storage-Add-Domains-to-Zscaler-URL-Category-API-Key**‚Äù and enter the Zscaler API key copied previously in the "**Value**" field. All other settings can be left as is. Click "**Create**". 

![Zscaler_Key_Vault_2](Images/Zscaler_Key_Vault_2.png)

Repeat this process for your Zscaler password. 

![Zscaler_Key_Vault_3](Images/Zscaler_Key_Vault_3.png)

Once both secrets have been added to the vault, navigate to the "**Access policies**" menu option. Leave this page open, as you will need to return to it once the playbook has been deployed. See [Granting Access to Azure Key Vault](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-Blob-Storage-Add-Domains-to-Zscaler-URL-Category#granting-access-to-azure-key-vault).

![Zscaler_Key_Vault_4](Images/Zscaler_Key_Vault_4.png)


#### Create an Integration Account:

You will need an integration account before this playbook can be deployed, as it is a requirement for executing JavaScript code, which is an operation used in the logic app.

Navigate to the Azure integration accounts page: https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Logic%2FintegrationAccounts

From the "**Overview**" page, select an existing integration account and take note of its name, or click "**Create**".

![Zscaler_Integration_Account_1](Images/Zscaler_Integration_Account_1.png)

Select the subscription and resource group that this playbook will be deployed to and a name for the integration account, such as "**AS-Zscaler-Integration**". Review the region and select a pricing tier, then click "**Review + create**".

![Zscaler_Integration_Account_2](Images/Zscaler_Integration_Account_2.png)

From the "**Review + create**" page, review the information, then click "**Create**".

![Zscaler_Integration_Account_3](Images/Zscaler_Integration_Account_3.png)

From the deployment page, take note of the resource name of your integration account, as it will be needed for deployment.

![Zscaler_Integration_Account_4](Images/Zscaler_Integration_Account_4.png)


#### Create Azure Blob Storage Container:

A blob storage file is needed for maintaining the Zscaler URL category values. Note the name and location of an existing one, or to create one, navigate to https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts

Create a storage account or select an existing one, then click the "**Containers**" menu option. Click the "**Container**" button and enter a name for the new container, such as "**zscaler-url-categories**", then click **Create**".

![Zscaler_Blob_Storage_1](Images/Zscaler_Blob_Storage_1.png)

Once your container has been created, you will need to upload a .csv file with the initial values of your Zscaler URL category. Click on your new container, then click "**Upload**" to open the dialogue box allowing you to upload your initial Zscaler URL category values in .csv format.

![Zscaler_Blob_Storage_2](Images/Zscaler_Blob_Storage_2.png)

You can easily view and edit the items in your file by clicking the ellipsis icon to the far right of the file and clicking "**View/edit**".

![Zscaler_Blob_Storage_3](Images/Zscaler_Blob_Storage_3.png)

Items can be added or removed on from the editable list. Once finished, click "**Save**".

![Zscaler_Blob_Storage_4](Images/Zscaler_Blob_Storage_4.png)

The logic app is set to run every 5 minutes polling this blob storage file for any changes. Because the logic app needs additional configuring after deployment, complete all deployment steps before testing any changes to this list, otherwise, time lapsed from now until then will likely put the last updated time outside of the polling window.
