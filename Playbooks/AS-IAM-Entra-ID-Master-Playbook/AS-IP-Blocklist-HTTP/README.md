This playbook is intended to be run from the AS-IAM-Entra-ID-Master-Playbook. It will add the IP address from Microsoft Sentinel Incidents to a Microsoft Azure Conditional Access Named Locations list, indicating compromised IP addresses.

### Requirements
                                                                                                                                     
The following items are required under the template settings during deployment: 

* A Microsoft Azure [Named Locations List](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-IAM-Entra-ID-Master-Playbook/AS-IP-Blocklist-HTTP#create-a-named-locations-list)
* An [App Registration](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-IAM-Entra-ID-Master-Playbook/AS-IP-Blocklist-HTTP#create-an-app-registration) for using the Microsoft Graph API
* An [Azure Key Vault Secret](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-IAM-Entra-ID-Master-Playbook/AS-IP-Blocklist-HTTP#create-an-azure-key-vault-secret) containing your App Registration Secret

### Setup
                                                                                                                                     
#### Create a Named Locations list:

Navigate to the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Menu:

https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview

From there, click the "**Security**" menu option.

![NamedLocations_Create_List_1](Images/NamedLocations_Create_List_1.png)

Navigate to the "**Named locations**" menu option and then click "**IP ranges location**".

![NamedLocations_Create_List_2](Images/NamedLocations_Create_List_2.png)

Create a name for your Named Locations list. The list cannot be saved without an initiating value. It should be noted IPs are only accepted in a CIDR range notation. Individual IPs processed by this playbook will have a "**/32**" appended to them to fit this format.

![NamedLocations_Create_List_3](Images/NamedLocations_Create_List_3.png)

The name of your Named Locations list, along with its ID, should be noted, as these will be required for the deployment of this playbook. 

The list ID may be more difficult to track down, as it is currently not displayed in the URL upon selection. Our solution for this was to send a GET request from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer to the following endpoint: https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/identity/conditionalAccess/namedLocations.

The JSON response body includes all Named Location lists, along with their IDs.


#### Create an App Registration:
 
Navigate to the Navigate to the Microsoft Azure Active Directory App Registrations page:

https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade

From there, click "**New registration**".

![NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_1](Images/NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_1.png)

Select a name for your App Registration, such as "**AS-IP-Blocklist-HTTP**", then click "**Register**".

![NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_2](Images/NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_2.png)

From the application menu blade, select "**API permissions**" and then click "**Add a permission**". Click the "**Microsoft Graph**" category.

![NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_3](Images/NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_3.png)

Under "**Application permissions**", search for "**Policy**", then select the "**Policy.Read.All**" and ""**Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess**" checkboxes. Click "**Add permissions**".

![NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_4](Images/NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_4.png)

In order for these permissions to be applied, admin consent must also be granted. Click the indicated "**Grant admin consent**" button on the "**API permissions**" page.
![NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_5_consent](Images/NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_5_consent.png)

Navigate back to the "**Overview**" section on the menu and take note of the "**Application (client) ID**" and "**Directory (tenant) ID**, as each will be needed for the deployment of this playbook. Click "**Add a certificate or secret**".

![NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_5](Images/NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_5.png)

Click "**New client secret"**". After adding a description and selecting an expiration date, click "**Add**".

![NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_6](Images/NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_6.png)

Copy the generated "**Value**" and save it for the next step, [Create an Azure Key Vault Secret](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-IAM-Entra-ID-Master-Playbook/AS-IP-Blocklist-HTTP#create-an-azure-key-vault-secret).

![NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_7](Images/NamedLocations_Create_App_Registration_7.png)


#### Create an Azure Key Vault Secret:

Navigate to the Azure Key Vaults page: https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.KeyVault%2Fvaults

Navigate to an existing Key Vault or create a new one. From the Key Vault overview page, click the "**Secrets**" menu option, found under the "**Settings**" section. Click "**Generate/Import**".

![NamedLocations_Key_Vault_1](Images/NamedLocations_Key_Vault_1.png)

Choose a name for the secret, such as "**AS-IP-Blocklist-HTTP-App-Registration-Secret**", and enter the App Registration Secret copied previously in the "**Value**" field. All other settings can be left as is. Click "**Create**". 

![NamedLocations_Key_Vault_2](Images/NamedLocations_Key_Vault_2.png)

Once your secret has been added to the vault, navigate to the "**Access policies**" menu option, also found under the "**Settings**" section on the Key Vault page menu. Leave this page open, as you will need to return to it once the playbook has been deployed. See [Granting Access to Azure Key Vault](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-IAM-Entra-ID-Master-Playbook/AS-IP-Blocklist-HTTP#granting-access-to-azure-key-vault).

### Granting Access to Azure Key Vault

Before the Logic App can run successfully, the Key Vault connection created during deployment must be granted access to the Key Vault storing your App Registration Secret.

From the Key Vault "**Access policies**" page, click "**Add Access Policy**".

![NamedLocations_Access_1](Images/NamedLocations_Access_1.png)
