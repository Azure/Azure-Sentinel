<a name="authentication">

## Authentication
Authentication methods this end point supports- [oauth2 authentication](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/46/crowdstrike-oauth2-based-apis#authenticating)

<a name="prerequisites">

### Prerequisites for using and deploying playbooks
1. Crowdstrike cloud end point should be known. (e.g.  https://{CrowdsrtikebaseURL})
1. User should know the Client ID and Client Secret values, and store them in a Key Vault. Least privileges permissions are Detections Read and Hosts Read for Enrichment playbook, add Hosts Write for containment playbook.
1. Key vault needs to be created, and include the Client ID and Secret, under the same subscription of the Playbooks. [learn how](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F201-key-vault-secret-create%2Fazuredeploy.json)
1. For playbook **Response From Teams**:
  * There should be a list of prewritten scripts created in Crowdstrike, so SOC analyst can choose from that list. [learn how to create scripts](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/71/real-time-response-and-network-containment#rtr_custom_scripts) our playbook does not provide an option to create a script.
  * To run a script user needs to be an RTR Active Responder and RTR Administrator in the falcon console. [Understand and assign Real Time Responder roles](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/71/real-time-response-and-network-containment#rtr_roles)
  * The following settings needs to be done on the host to run a script:
    *  Configure [Response Policies](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/71/real-time-response-and-network-containment#rtr-policy-config) - create policies and assign host groups to them
    *  Enable the toggle real time functionality and enable custom scripts toggle to run them in [Real time response policy settings](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/71/real-time-response-and-network-containment#rtr-policy-config)
