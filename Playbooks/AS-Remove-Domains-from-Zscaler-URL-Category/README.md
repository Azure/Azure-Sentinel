This playbook is intended to be run from a Microsoft Sentinel incident. It will extract domains from Microsoft Sentinel incidents and remove them from a Zscaler Custom URL Category of your choice. This playbook is meant to be used in tandem with [AS-Add-Domains-to-Zscaler-URL-Category](https://github.com/Accelerynt-Security/Zscaler-add-Domains-to-URL-Category)

### Requirements

The following items are required under the template settings during deployment: 

* The URL of your Zscaler organization
* A configured Zscaler [admin account](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-Remove-Domains-from-Zscaler-URL-Category#zscaler-admin-account)
* A Zscaler [API key](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-Remove-Domains-from-Zscaler-URL-Category#zscaler-api-key)
* The name of the [Zscaler custom URL category](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-Remove-Domains-from-Zscaler-URL-Category#zscaler-url-category) you wish to remove the Microsoft Sentinel incident domains from
* A Microsoft Azure [integration account](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-Remove-Domains-from-Zscaler-URL-Category#create-an-integration-account)
* A Microsoft Azure [key vault secret](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-Remove-Domains-from-Zscaler-URL-Category#create-azure-key-vault-secrets) containing your Okta API Token

# 
### Setup

#### Zscaler Admin Account:

Before deployment, you will need to configure your Zscaler API roles and API admin account.  

For this Playbook to modify your Zscaler custom domain list, you will need a local Zscaler admin account that has access to the read and modify policy. To limit the access this account has to only what is needed, you will need to make a custom administrator role. 

In the Zscaler administration console hover over **Administration then click on Role Management**.

Click on **Add Administrator Role**.

![](Images/zgit1a.png)

Create a **Name** for the **Administrator Role** and use the settings **exactly** as depicted in the image below. Then click the **Save** button.

![](Images/zgit2.png)

Hover over the **Activation** button and click **Activate** to enable the new Role.

![](Images/Activate.png)

Next, hover over **Administration** and click on **Administrator Management**.

![](Images/zgit4.png)

Click on **Add Administrator**.

![](Images/zgit5.png)

Enter a **Login ID** for the API administrator account you want to create. 

In the **Email** box you can enter a pre-existing service account, or simply make up an email address which you will not use in your domain. There is no need for email access for this account.

Enter a name for the account and in the drop-down box below, select the Role you created in the previous step.

Make sure **Password Based Login** is checked and create a secure password for this API account.

Take note of the email address and password, as it will be needed during deployment.

![](Images/zgit6.png)

Click **Save**, then hover over the **Activation** button and click **Activate**. This will enable the new administrator account.

![](Images/Activate.png)

#### Zscaler API Key:

To get your **API key** hover over the **Administration** button and click on **API Key Management**.

![](Images/zgit7.png)

Here you will find you **API Key** as well as **Zscaler Instance Name.** You will need both of these when deploying this playbook. The typical instance names are Zscaler, ZscalerOne, ZscalerTwo, ZscalerThree, and ZsCloud.

![](Images/zgit8.png)

#### Zscaler URL Category:

Lastly, you will need to note the custom URL category you want the domains from Microsoft Sentinel incidents to be removed from. 

Hover over the **Administration** button and click on **URL Categories.** 

Take note of the name of your desired URL category, as it will be needed during deployment. 

In the example below we use name of our Custom category AS_Blocklist. 
This category in our test environment configured to a Zscaler access policy that disallows users access to any domain in in that list.

#### Create an Integration Account:

You will need an integration account before this playbook can be deployed, as it is a requirement for executing JavaScript code, which is an operation used in the logic app.

Navigate to the Azure integration accounts page: https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Logic%2FintegrationAccounts

From the "**Overview**" page, select an existing integration account and take note of its name, or click "**Create**".

![Zscaler_Integration_Account_1](Images/Zscaler_Integration_Account_1.png)

Select the subscription and resource group that this playbook will be deployed to and a name for the integration account, such as "**AS-Zscaler-Integration**". Review the region and select a pricing tier, then click "**Review + create**".

![Zscaler_Integration_Account_2](Images/Zscaler_Integration_Account_2.png)

From the "**Review + create**" page, review the information, then click "**Create**".

![Zscaler_Integration_Account_3](Images/Zscaler_Integration_Account_3.png)

From the deployment page, take note of the resource name of your integration account, as it will be needed for deployment.

![Zscaler_Integration_Account_4](Images/Zscaler_Integration_Account_4.png)

#### Create Azure Key Vault Secrets:

You will need to add you Zscaler API key and Zscaler password to an Azure key vault.

Navigate to the Azure key vaults page: https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.KeyVault%2Fvaults

Select an existing key vault or create a new one. From the key vault overview page, click the "**Secrets**" menu option, found under the "**Settings**" section. Click "**Generate/Import**".

![Zscaler_Key_Vault_1](Images/Zscaler_Key_Vault_1.png)

Choose a name for the secret, such as "**AS-Zscaler-Integration-API-Key**” and enter the Zscaler API key copied previously in the "**Value**" field. All other settings can be left as is. Click "**Create**". 

![Zscaler_Key_Vault_2](Images/Zscaler_Key_Vault_2.png)

Repeat this process for your Zscaler password. 

![Zscaler_Key_Vault_3](Images/Zscaler_Key_Vault_3.png)

Once both secrets have been added to the vault, navigate to the "**Access policies**" menu option, also found under the "**Settings**" section on the key vault page menu. Leave this page open, as you will need to return to it once the playbook has been deployed. See [Granting Access to Azure Key Vault](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/AS-Remove-Domains-from-Zscaler-URL-Category#granting-access-to-azure-key-vault).
