# SentinelOne ASIM ProcessEvent Normalization Parser

ARM template for ASIM ProcessEvent schema parser for SentinelOne.

This ASIM parser supports normalizing SentinelOne logs to the ASIM Process Event normalized schema. SentinelOne events are captured through SentinelOne data connector which ingests SentinelOne server objects such as Threats, Agents, Applications, Activities, Policies, Groups, and more events into Microsoft Sentinel through the REST API.


The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
