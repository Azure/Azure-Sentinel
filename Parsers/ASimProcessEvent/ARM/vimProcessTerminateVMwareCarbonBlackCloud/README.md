# VMware Carbon Black Cloud ASIM ProcessEvent Normalization Parser

ARM template for ASIM ProcessEvent schema parser for VMware Carbon Black Cloud.

This ASIM parser supports normalizing VMware Carbon Black Cloud logs to the ASIM Process Terminate normalized schema. VMware Carbon Black Cloud events are captured through VMware Carbon Black Cloud data connector which ingests Carbon Black Audit, Notification and Event data into Microsoft Sentinel through the REST API.


The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
