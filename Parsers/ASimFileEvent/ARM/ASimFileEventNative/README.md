# Native ASIM FileEvent Normalization Parser

ARM template for ASIM FileEvent schema parser for Native.

This ASIM parser supports normalizing the native File Event table (ASimFileEventLogs) to the ASIM File Event normalized schema. While the native table is ASIM compliant, the parser is needed to add capabilities, such as aliases, available only at query time.


The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
