# Trend Micro Vision One ASIM RegistryEvent Normalization Parser

ARM template for ASIM RegistryEvent schema parser for Trend Micro Vision One.

This ASIM parser supports normalizing Trend Micro Vision One logs to the ASIM Registry Event normalized schema. Trend Micro Vision One events are captured through Trend Vision One data connector which ingests XDR logs into Microsoft Sentinel through the Trend Vision One API.


The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
