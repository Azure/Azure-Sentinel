# Native ASIM DhcpEvent Normalization Parser

ARM template for ASIM DhcpEvent schema parser for Native.

This ASIM parser supports filtering and normalizing the native Dhcp Event table (ASimDhcpEventLogs) to the ASIM Dhcp Event normalized schema. While the native table is ASIM compliant, the parser is needed to add capabilities, such as aliases, available only at query time.


The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
