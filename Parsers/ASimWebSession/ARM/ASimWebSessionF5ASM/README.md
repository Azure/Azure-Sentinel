# F5 BIG-IP Application Security Manager (ASM) ASIM WebSession Normalization Parser

ARM template for ASIM WebSession schema parser for F5 BIG-IP Application Security Manager (ASM).

This ASIM parser supports normalizing F5 Big IP ASM(Application Security Manager) logs to the ASIM Web Session normalized schema. F5 Big IP ASM events are captured through F5 Network data connector which ingests attack events and data into Microsoft Sentinel in CEF format over Syslog using F5's technology partner Arcsight.


The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
