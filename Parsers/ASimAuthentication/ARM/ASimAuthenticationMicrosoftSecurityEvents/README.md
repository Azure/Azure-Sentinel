# Security Events ASIM Authentication Normalization Parser

ARM template for ASIM Authentication schema parser for Security Events.

This ASIM parser supports normalizing Security Authentication events (4624, 4625, 4634, and 4647), collected either by the Azure Monitor Agent, into SecurityEvent tables, to the ASIM Authentication schema.


The Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
