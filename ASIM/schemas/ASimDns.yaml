# DNS event fields
- Name: DnsQuery
  Class: Mandatory
  Type:  string
  Description: The domain that the request tries to resolve.
  Notes: |
    - Some sources send valid FQDN queries in a different format. For example, in the DNS protocol itself, the query includes a dot (.) at the end, which must be removed.
    - While the DNS protocol limits the type of value in this field to an FQDN, most DNS servers allow any value, and this field is therefore not limited to FQDN values only. Most notably, DNS tunneling attacks may use invalid FQDN values in the query field.
    - While the DNS protocol allows for multiple queries in a single request, this scenario is rare, if it's found at all. If the request has multiple queries, store the first one in this field, and then and optionally keep the rest in the AdditionalFields field.
  Example: www.malicious.com

- Name: Domain
  Class: Alias
  Type: string
  Aliases: DnsQuery
  Description: Alias to DnsQuery.

- Name: DnsQueryType
  Class: Optional
  Type: integer
  Description: The DNS Resource Record Type codes.
  Example: 28

- Name: DnsQueryTypeName
  Class: Recommended
  Type: string
  Logical type:  Enumerated
  List of values: TBD
  Description: The DNS Resource Record Type names.
  Notes: |
    - IANA doesn't define the case for the values, so analytics must normalize the case as needed.
    - The value ANY is supported for the response code 255.
    - The value TYPExxxx is supported for unmapped response codes, where xxxx is the numerical value of the response code, as reported by the BIND DNS server.
    - If the source provides only a numerical query type code and not a query type name, the parser must include a lookup table to enrich with this value.
  Example: AAAA

- Name: DnsResponseName
  Class: Optional
  Type:  string
  Description: The content of the response, as included in the record.
  Notes: The DNS response data is inconsistent across reporting devices, is complex to parse, and has less value for source-agnostic analytics. Therefore the information model doesn't require parsing and normalization, and Microsoft Sentinel uses an auxiliary function to provide response information. For more information, see Handling DNS response.

- Name: DnsResponseCodeName
  Class: Alias
  Type: string
  Aliases: EventResultDetails
  Description: Alias to EventResultDetails

- Name: DnsResponseCode
  Class: Optional
  Type:  integer
  Description: The DNS numerical response code.
  Example: 3

- Name: TransactionIdHex
  Class:  Recommended
  Type:  string
  Description:  The DNS query unique ID as assigned by the DNS client, in hexadecimal format. Note that this value is part of the DNS protocol and different from DnsSessionId, the network layer session ID, typically assigned by the reporting device.

- Name: NetworkProtocol
  Class: Optional
  Type: string
  Logical type:  Enumerated
  List of values: [TCP UDP]
  Description: The transport protocol used by the network resolution event. The value can be UDP or TCP, and is most commonly set to UDP for DNS.
  Example: UDP

- Name: NetworkProtocolVersion
  Class: Optional
  Type: string
  Logical type:  Enumerated
  List of values: TBD

- Name: DnsQueryClass
  Class: Optional
  Type:  integer
  Description: The DNS class ID. In practice, only the IN class (ID 1) is used, and therefore this field is less valuable.

- Name: DnsQueryClassName
  Class: Optional
  Type:  string
  Logical type: Enumerated
  List of values: TBD
  Description: The DNS class name. In practice, only the IN class (ID 1) is used, and therefore this field is less valuable.
  Example: IN

- Name: DnsFlags
  Class: Optional
  Type: string
  Description: List of strings  The flags field, as provided by the reporting device. If flag information is provided in multiple fields, concatenate them with comma as a separator.
  Notes: Since DNS flags are complex to parse and are less often used by analytics, parsing, and normalization aren't required. Microsoft Sentinel can use an auxiliary function to provide flags information. For more information, see Handling DNS response.
  Example: "DR"

- Name: DnsNetworkDuration
  Class: Optional
  Type:  integer
  Description:  The amount of time, in milliseconds, for the completion of DNS request.

For more information, see RFC 3655 Section 6.1 for more information.

- Name: DnsFlagsAuthoritative
  Class: Optional
  Type: bool
  Description: The DNS AA flag indicates whether the response from the server was authoritative

- Name: DnsFlagsCheckingDisabled
  Class: Optional
  Type: bool
  Description: The DNS CD flag, which is related to DNSSEC, indicates in a query that non-verified data is acceptable to the system sending the query. For more information, see RFC 3655 Section 6.1 for more information.

- Name: DnsFlagsRecursionAvailable
  Class: Optional
  Type: bool
  Description: The DNS RA flag indicates in a response that that server supports recursive queries.

- Name: DnsFlagsRecursionDesired
  Class: Optional
  Type: bool
  Description: The DNS RD flag indicates in a request that that client would like the server to use recursive queries.

- Name: DnsFlagsTruncated
  Class: Optional
  Type: bool
  Description: The DNS TC flag indicates that a response was truncated as it exceeded the maximum response size.

- Name: DnsFlagsZ
  Class: Optional
  Type: bool
  Description: The DNS Z flag is a deprecated DNS flag, which might be reported by older DNS systems.

- Name: DnsSessionId
