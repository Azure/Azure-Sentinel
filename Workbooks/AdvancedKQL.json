Each task includes KQL operators used, sample queries and use cases.<br/>\r\n- Compiling a list of existing content found in Microsoft Sentinel (Analytics Rules, Hunting Queries, Workbooks and etc) to provide additional references specific to the KQL operators you want to learn.\r\n- Allowing you to execute the sample queries on the fly with your own environment or \"LA Demo\" - a public demo environment. Try the sample KQL statements in real time without the need to navigate away from the Workbook.<br/> (**Note**: if using your own workspace, you need to ensure you have the relevant data already ingested) \r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><u>How to use this Workbook</u></h3>\r\n\r\n1. Begin by select a **Category** that suits the outcomes you would like to achieve with KQL. Alternatively, you can refer to \"**Table of Contents**\" for an overview of what is covered under each Category.\r\n\r\n2. After clicking on a Category, you will be presented a list of tasks under \"**I want to**\". Select a task that suits your requirement.\r\n\r\n3. Review the Operators, sample queries, sample use cases and reference resources found in Microsoft Sentinel accordingly.\r\n\r\n4. Try the queries in your own environment or \"LA Demo\" using the \"**Try it**\" buttons.<br/><br/>\r\n**Note:** <br/>\r\n - \"**Try it in your environment**\" button will only be visible when the **Workspace parameter** at the top of the Workbook is populated. <br/>\r\n - **LA Demo** environment might not have all the tables or data specified for each sample queries and use cases.\r\n\r\n <br/>\r\n ",

The name can then be used to refer to its bound value as [user-defined functions and views](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/functions/user-defined-functions).\r\n\r\nYou can also [save query as function](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/functions#create-a-function) and run the query regulary by calling the function name without the need of re-writing the whole query.\r\n\r\nParameters can be added to functions as input arguments so that you can provide values for certain variables when calling it. This allows the same function to be used in different queries, each providing different values for the parameters. \r\n\r\nIn Microsoft Sentinel, the [Microsoft Sentinel Information Model (ASIM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/normalization-about-parsers) parsers leverage functions to parse and normalize data at query time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n"

The ability of a SIEM solution to aggregate data from multiple sources, analyse and generate high fidelity incidents is of paramount importance. SIEM solutions accomplish this desired outcome via the process of event correlation. The ability to correlate various log sources is perhaps one of the most powerful features of a SIEM. This is because correlation brings out more relevant context and insights by stitching together events that on their own may pass as benign but taken together in a particular sequence or conditions could be uncover nefarious activity. Correlation in Microsoft Sentinel can be achieved broadly using the ‘join’ or ‘union’ commands with each of the commands having various flavors depending on the use-case to be fulfilled. Below is a summary of flavours available via the correlation options:\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nSummary of 'join' flavors <br>\r\n\r\n|No|Type       |Output schema           |\r\n|--|---------------|--------------------|\r\n|1|kind=leftanti, kind=leftantisemi|Returns all the records from the left side that don't have matches from the right|\r\n|2|kind=rightanti, kind=rightantisemi|Returns all the records from the right side that don't have matches from the left.|\r\n|3|kind unspecified, kind=innerunique |Only one row from the left side is matched for each value of the on key. The output contains a row for each match of this row with rows from the right.|\r\n|4|kind=leftsemi|Returns all the records from the left side that have matches from the right.|\r\n|5 |kind=rightsemi|Returns all the records from the right side that have matches from the left.|\r\n|6|kind=inner|Contains a row in the output for every combination of matching rows from left and right.|\r\n|7|kind=leftouter (or kind=rightouter or kind=fullouter)|Contains a row for every row on the left and right, even if it has no match. The unmatched output cells contain nulls.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nSummary of 'union' flavors <br>\r\n\r\n|No|Type       |Output schema           |\r\n|--|---------------|--------------------|\r\n|1|inner|The result has the subset of columns that are common to all of the input tables.|\r\n|2|outer|(default). The result has all the columns that occur in any of the inputs. Cells that weren't defined by an input row are set to null.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [join](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/joinoperator?pivots=azuredataexplorer)\r\n- [union](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/unionoperator?pivots=azuredataexplorer)\r\n- [project](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectoperator)\r\n"

Parsing this data into multiple properties make it easier to use in queries. A common example is a custom log that collects an entire log entry with multiple values into a single property. By creating separate properties for the different values, you can search and aggregate on each.

Once created, these can be used in search, detection rules, threat hunting and automated responses.\r\n\r\nCommon scenarios for using watchlists include:\r\n\r\n1. Investigating threats and responding to incidents quickly with the rapid import of IP addresses, file hashes, and other data from CSV files. Once imported, you can use watchlist name-value pairs for joins and filters in alert rules, threat hunting, workbooks, notebooks, and general queries.\r\n\r\n2. Importing business data as a watchlist. For example, import user lists with privileged system access, or terminated employees, and then use the watchlist to create allowlists and blocklists used to detect or prevent those users from logging in to the network.\r\n\r\n3. Reducing alert fatigue. Create allowlists to suppress alerts from a group of users, such as users from authorized IP addresses that perform tasks that would normally trigger the alert, and prevent benign events from becoming alerts.\r\n\r\n4. Enriching event data. Use watchlists to enrich your event data with name-value combinations derived from external data sources.\r\n\r\n[Use Microsoft Sentinel Watchlists](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/kusto/query/ingestiontimefunctionhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/watchlists)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n"
