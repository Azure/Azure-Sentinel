An attacker can exploit this to have an unspecified impact.  No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1612)\n - A use-after-free error exists in `PDFium` due to improper invalidation of `IPWL_FocusHandler` and `IPWL_Provider` upon destruction.  An attacker can exploit this to dereference already freed memory, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1613)\n - An unspecified vulnerability exists in `Blink` that is related to the handling of bitmaps.  An attacker can exploit this to access sensitive information.  No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1614)\n - An unspecified vulnerability exists in `omnibox` that is related to origin confusion.  An attacker can exploit this to have an unspecified impact.  No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1615)\n - An unspecified vulnerability exists that allows an attacker to spoof a displayed URL.  No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1616)\n - An unspecified vulnerability exists that is related to history sniffing with HSTS and CSP. No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1617)\n - A flaw exists in `Blink` due to the weak generation of random numbers by the ARC4-based random number generator.  An attacker can exploit this to gain access to sensitive information.  No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1618)\n - An out-of-bounds read error exists in `PDFium` in file `fx_codec_jpx_opj.cpp` in the `sycc4{22,44}_to_rgb()` functions. An attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service by crashing the application linked using the library. (CVE-2016-1619)\n - Multiple vulnerabilities exist, the most serious of which allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web page. (CVE-2016-1620)\n - A flaw in `objects.cc` is triggered when handling cleared `WeakCells`, which may allow a context-dependent attacker to have an unspecified impact. No further details have been provided. (CVE-2016-2051)",
