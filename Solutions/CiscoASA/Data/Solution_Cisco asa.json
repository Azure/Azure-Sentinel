  "Description": "The [Cisco ASA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/products/security/adaptive-security-appliance-asa-software/index.html) solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables you to ingest [Cisco ASA logs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/syslog/b_syslog/messages-listed-by-severity-level.html) into Microsoft Sentinel. This solution includes two (2) data connectors to help ingest the logs.\n\r\n1. **Cisco ASA/FTD via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting Cisco ASA logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**\n\r\n2. **Cisco ASA via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Cisco ASA logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n<P style=\"color:red\">**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends Installation of Cisco ASA/FTD via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31,2024** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported.</p>\n\n**Underlying Microsoft Technologies used:**\n\nThis solution takes a dependency on the following technologies, and some of these dependencies either may be in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) state or might result in additional ingestion or operational costs:\n\n a.
