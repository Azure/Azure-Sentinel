The integration has two main parts: first, URL detonation and enrichment, which provides detailed insights into suspicious URLs. Second, it automatically generates and feeds threat intelligence for all submissions to JoeSandbox, improving threat detection and incident response in Sentinel. This seamless integration empowers teams to proactively address emerging threats.",
