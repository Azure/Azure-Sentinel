Remediate threats quickly with the power of network detection and response and speed up investigations with deep visibility especially into unmanaged entities including users, devices and applications on your network. The connector also enables the creation of network security-focused custom alerts, incidents, workbooks and notebooks that align with your existing security operations workflows. ",
