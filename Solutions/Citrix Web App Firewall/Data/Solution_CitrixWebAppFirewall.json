	"Description": "[Citrix Web App Firewall (WAF)](https://www.citrix.com/products/citrix-web-app-firewall/) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables ingestion of Common Event Format (CEF) logs into Microsoft Sentinel to enable you to take advantage of search & correlation, alerting, and threat intelligence enrichment for each log.\n\r\n1. **Citrix Web App Firewall via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting Citrix Web App Firewall logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **Citrix Web App Firewall via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Citrix Web App Firewall logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of Citrix Web App Firewall via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
