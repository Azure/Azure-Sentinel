Citrix WAF mitigates threats against your public-facing assets, including websites, apps, and APIs. From layer 3 to layer 7, Citrix WAF includes protections such as IP reputation, bot mitigation, defense against the OWASP Top 10 application threats, built-in signatures to protect against application stack vulnerabilities, and more. \n\nCitrix WAF supports Common Event Format (CEF) which is an industry standard format on top of Syslog messages . By connecting Citrix WAF CEF logs to Microsoft Sentinel, you can take advantage of search & correlation, alerting, and threat intelligence enrichment for each log.",
