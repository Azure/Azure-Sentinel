	"Description": "The [Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/web-security-appliance/index.html) solution provides the capability to ingest [Cisco WSA Access Logs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/wsa/wsa_14-0/User-Guide/b_WSA_UserGuide_14_0/b_WSA_UserGuide_11_7_chapter_010101.html) into Microsoft Sentinel.\n\n This solution is dependent on the Syslog solution containing the Syslog via AMA connector to collect the logs. The Syslog solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n **NOTE**: Microsoft recommends installation of Syslog via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024**. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
