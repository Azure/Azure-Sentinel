	"Description": "The [AI Analyst Darktrace](https://www.darktrace.com/en/cyber-ai-analyst/) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel lets users connect Darktrace Model Breaches in real-time with Microsoft Sentinel, allowing creation of custom Dashboards, Workbooks, Notebooks and Custom Alerts to improve investigation. Microsoft Sentinel's enhanced visibility into Darktrace logs enables monitoring and mitigation of security threats.\n\n This solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors are about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024.**",
