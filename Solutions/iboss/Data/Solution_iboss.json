  "Description": "The iboss Solution provides means to connect your Threat Console to Microsoft Sentinel and enrich your instance with iboss URL event logs. Our logs are forwarded in Common Event Format (CEF) over Syslog and the configuration required can be completed on the iboss platform without the use of a proxy. Take advantage of our connector to garner critical data points and gain insight into security threats.\n\n This solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors are about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024.**",
