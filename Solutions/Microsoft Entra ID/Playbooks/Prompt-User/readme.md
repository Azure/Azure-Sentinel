# Prompt-User
author: Nicholas DiCola

This playbook will ask the user if they completed the action from the Incident in Microsoft Sentinel.  If so, it will close the incident and add a comment.  If not, it will post a message to teams for the SOC to investigate and add a comment to the incident.

## Quick Deployment
**Deploy with incident trigger** (recommended)

After deployment, attach this playbook to an **automation rule** so it runs when the incident is created.
