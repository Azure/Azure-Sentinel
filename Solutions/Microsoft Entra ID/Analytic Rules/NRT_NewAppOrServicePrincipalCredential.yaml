name: NRT New access credential added to Application or Service Principal
description: |
  'This will alert when an admin or app owner account adds a new credential to an Application or Service Principal where a verify KeyCredential was already present for the app.
  If a threat actor obtains access to an account with sufficient privileges and adds the alternate authentication material triggering this event, the threat actor can now authenticate as the Application or Service Principal using this credential.
