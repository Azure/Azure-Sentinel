### Post-Deployment instructions 
#### a. Create Automation Rule
Once deployment is complete, optionally we need to create an Incident-based Automation Rule to reflect changes from the Incident in Microsoft Sentinel back to Jamf Protect [learn how](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/automate-incident-handling-with-automation-rules)
- 1. In Microsoft Sentinel Analytic Rules for Jamf Protect - Alerts should be configured to create an incident.
- 2. Configure the Automation Rules to trigger this playbook once a incident is status is changed to Active.

## Playbook steps explained

### Microsoft Sentinel Incident
When an Incident is being created and we have an Automation Rule in place to rule this trigger we can use the Incident details.

### set jamfProtectAlertURL as variable
Initialize a string variable which uses the JamfProtectURL Parameter.

### Generate Access Token
This HTTP action will generate an Access Token using the defined parameters.

### Parse JSON Response from Access Token
This action parses the response from the previous HTTP action in a format so we can use it further in the Playbook.

### Set accessToken as variable
Initialize a string variable which uses the Output from the previous JSON parse action.

### For each
Runs a set of actions for each Incident

    ### Composing Jam Protect Alert URL
    This action will get the unique vendor URL of the Entities section of the Incident.

    ### Removing pre-fix of URL and keeping Alert UDID
    This action will get the unique vendor URL and remove the prefixes so we only hold the UUID of the event.

    ### HTTP POST - Change Alert Status using Jam Protect's GraphQL API Endpoint
    This action will send an HTTP POST request to Jamf Protec's GraphQL endpoints to change the Alert status to InProgress

    ### Add comment to incident (V3)
    This action creates an Comment in the related Incident that the Alert has been set to InProgress.
