  "Description": "The [FireEye Network Security (NX)](https://www.fireeye.com/products/network-security.html) solution provides the capability to ingest FireEye Network Security logs into Microsoft Sentinel.\n\r\n1. **FireEye Network Security via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting FireEye Network Security logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **FireEye Network Security via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting FireEye Network Security logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of FireEye Network Security via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
