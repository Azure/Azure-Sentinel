    "Description": "The data connector for [Mimecast Secure Email Gateway](https://integrations.mimecast.com/tech-partners/microsoft-sentinel/) allows easy log collection from the Secure Email Gateway to surface email insight and user activity within Microsoft Sentinel. The data connector provides pre-created dashboards to allow analysts to view insight into email based threats, aid in incident correlation and reduce investigation response times coupled with custom alert capabilities. Mimecast products and features required: \n- Mimecast Secure Email Gateway \n- Mimecast Data Leak Prevention\n \n\nMicrosoft Sentinel Solutions provide a consolidated way to acquire Microsoft Sentinel content like data connectors, workbooks, analytics, and automations in your workspace with a single deployment step.\n\n**NOTE: This integration is considered deprecated and has been replaced by the unified [Mimecast integration](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/mimecastnorthamerica1584469118674.azure-sentinel-solution-mimecast?tab=Overview), which uses Mimecast's API 2.0 gateway. Please avoid using this version, and if already using it, migrate to the new integration. No further updates will be performed, and this version will be removed at a future date.
