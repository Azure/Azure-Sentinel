# RiskIQ-Data-Summary

## Overview
This playbook uses the RiskIQ PassiveTotal connector to automatically enrich incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel. The RiskIQ summary data will provide analysts with an understanding of what RiskIQ knows about a given indicator extracted from the incident in the form of result counts with corresponding data sets. Each data set will be linked, making it easy for an analyst to one-click pivot into a deeper investigation.

## Prerequisites
This playbook inherits API connections created and established within a base playbook. Ensure you have deployed [RiskIQ-Base](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/RiskIQ/Playbooks/RiskIQ-Base/azuredeploy.json) prior to deploying this playbook. You will need your API credentials (email/secret) when configuring that playbook. Those can be found on your [account settings](https://community.riskiq.com/settings) page. For enterprise customers, it's preferred to use the "organization" credential pair, not the user. If you have trouble accessing your account or your credentials contact your account representative (support[@]riskiq.com).

### Post-Deployment Instructions
After deploying the playbook, you must authorize the connections leveraged.

1. Visit the playbook resource.
2. Under "Development Tools" (located on the left), click "API Connections".
3. Ensure each connection has been authorized.

**Note: If you've deployed the [RiskIQ-Base](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/RiskIQ/Playbooks/RiskIQ-Base/azuredeploy.json) playbook, you will only need to authorize the Microsoft Sentinel connection.**
