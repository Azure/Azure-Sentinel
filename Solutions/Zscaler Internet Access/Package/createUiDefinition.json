Using Zscaler on Microsoft Sentinel will provide you more insights into your organization’s Internet usage and will enhance its security operation capabilities. \r\n \r\n For more details about this solution refer to [https://help.zscaler.com/zia/zscaler-microsoft-azure-sentinel-deployment-guide](https://help.zscaler.com/zia/zscaler-microsoft-azure-sentinel-deployment-guide) \n\r\n1. **Zscaler via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting Zscaler logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **Zscaler via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Zscaler logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of Zscaler via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).\n\n**Data Connectors:** 2, **Parsers:** 2, **Workbooks:** 4, **Analytic Rules:** 2, **Function Apps:** 1, **Playbooks:** 3\n\n[Learn more about Microsoft Sentinel](https://aka.ms/azuresentinel) | [Learn more about Solutions](https://aka.ms/azuresentinelsolutionsdoc)",
