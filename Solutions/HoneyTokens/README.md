# Microsoft Sentinel Deception (HoneyTokens) Solution - Community Supported

For more details: <br>
Blog post: https://aka.ms/honeytokensblog<br>

> **IMPORTANT** <br>
> The Microsoft Sentinel Deception (Honey Tokens) solution is offered in a community supported model by the [Microsoft SIEM & XDR Community](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/wiki). Any support required can be raised as an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/issues) on GitHub where the Microsoft Sentinel community can assist. 

This article describes how to use the **Microsoft Sentinel Deception (Honey Tokens)** solution to plant decoy [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/index.yml) keys and secrets, called *honeytokens*, into existing workloads.

Use the [analytics rules](detect-threats-built-in.md), [watchlists](watchlists.md), and [workbooks](monitor-your-data.md) provided by the solution to monitor access to the deployed honeytokens.

When using honeytokens in your system, detection principles remains the same. Because there is no legitimate reason to access a honeytoken, any activity will indicate the presence of a user who is not familiar with the environment, and could potentially be an attacker.

## Before you begin

In order to start using the **Microsoft Sentinel Deception (Honey Tokens)** solution, make sure that you have:

- **Required roles**: You must be a tenant admin to install the **Microsoft Sentinel Deception (Honey Tokens)** solution. Once the solution is installed, you can share the workbook with key vault owners so that they can deploy their own honeytokens.

- **Required data connectors**: Make sure that you've deployed the [Azure Key Vault](data-connectors-reference.md#azure-key-vault) and the [Azure Activity](data-connectors-reference.md#azure-activity) data connectors in your workspace, and that they're connected.

  Verify that data routing succeeded and that the **KeyVault** and **AzureActivity** data is flowing into Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, see:

  - [Connect Microsoft Sentinel to Azure, Windows, Microsoft, and Amazon services](https://connect-azure-windows-microsoft-services.md?tabs=AP#diagnostic-settings-based-connections)
  - [Find your Microsoft Sentinel data connector](data-connectors-reference.md)

## Install the solution

Install the **Microsoft Sentinel Deception (Honey Tokens)** solution as you would [other solutions](sentinel-solutions-deploy.md). On the **Microsoft Sentinel Deception** solution page, select **Start** to get started.

![Screenshot of the create solution page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/honeytoken-create-solution.png)

**To install the Deception solution**:

The following steps describe specific actions required for the **Microsoft Sentinel Deception (Honey Tokens)** solution.

1. On the **Basics** tab, select the same resource group where your Microsoft Sentinel workspace is located.

1. On the **Prerequisites** tab, in the **Function app name** field, enter a meaningful name for the Azure function app that will create honeytokens in your key vaults.

    The function app name must be unique, between 2-22 characters in length, and alphanumeric characters only.

    A command is displayed below with the name you've defined. For example:

    ![Screenshot of the prerequisites tab showing the updated curl command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/prerequisites.png)

1. <a name="secret"></a>Select **Click here to open a cloud shell** to open a Cloud Shell tab. Sign in if prompted, and then run the command displayed.

    The script you run creates an Azure AD (AAD) function app, which will deploy your honeytokens.    For example:

    ```bash
    Requesting a Cloud Shell.Succeeded
    Connecting terminal...

    Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell

    Type "az" to use Azure CLI
    Type "help" to learn about Cloud Shell

    maria@Azure:~$curl -sL https://aka.ms/sentinelhoneytokensappcreate | bash -s HoneyTokenFunctionApp
    ```

    The script output includes the AAD app ID and secret. For example:

    ```bash
    WARNING: The output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control. For more information, see https://aka.ms/azadsp-cli
    function app name: HoneyTokenFunctionApp
    AAD App Id: k4js48k3-97gg-3958=sl8d=48620nne59k4
    AAD App secret: v9kUtSoy3u~K8DKa8DlILsCM_K-s9FR3Kj
    maria@Azure:~$
    ```

1. Back in Microsoft Sentinel, at the bottom of **Prerequisites** tab, enter the AAD app ID and secret into the relevant fields. For example:

    ![Screenshot of the function app's client app and secret values added](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/client-app-secret-values.png)

1. Select **Click here to continue in your function app settings** under step 4. A new browser tab opens in the Azure AD application settings.

    Sign in if prompted, and then select **Grant admin consent for `<your directory name>`** to continue. For example:

    ![Screenshot of the grant admin consent for your directory button](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/grant-admin-access.png)

    For more information, see [Grant admin consent in App registrations](../active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent.md).

1. Back in Microsoft Sentinel again, on the **Workbooks**, **Analytics**, **Watchlists**, and **Playbooks** tabs, note the security content that will be created, and modify the names as needed.

    > **NOTE** <br>
    > Other instructions in this article refer to the **HoneyTokensIncidents** and **SOCHTManagement** workbooks. If you change the names of these workbooks, make sure to note the new workbook names for your own reference and use them as needed instead of the default names.

1. On the **Azure Functions** tab, define the following values:

    **Key vault configuration**: The following fields define values for the key vault where you'll store your AAD app's secret. These fields do not *not* define the the key vault where you'll be deploying honeytokens.

    |Field  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    | **Service plan**     |   Select whether you want to use a **Premium** or **Consumption** plan for your function app. For more information, see [Azure Functions Consumption plan hosting](../azure-functions/consumption-plan.md) and [Azure Functions Premium plan](../azure-functions/functions-premium-plan.md).      |
    | **Should a new KeyVault be created**     |    Select **new** to create a new key vault for your app's secret, or **existing** to use an already existing key vault.   |
    | **KeyVault name**     | Displayed only when you've selected to create a new key vault. <br><br>Enter the name of the key vault you want to use to store your app's secret. This name must be globally unique.     |
    | **KeyVault resource group**     |Displayed only when you've selected to create a new key vault. <br><br> Select the name of the resource group where you want to store the key vault for your application key.      |
    | **Existing key vaults** | Displayed only when you've selected to use an existing key vault. Select the key vault you want to use. |
    | **KeyVault secret name**     |  Enter a name for the secret where you want to store your AAD app's secret. You'd created this AAP app back in [step 3](#secret). |

    **Honeytoken configuration**: The following fields define settings used for the keys and secrets used in your honeytokens. Use naming conventions that will blend in with your organization's naming requirements so that attackers will not be able to tell the difference.

    |Field  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Keys keywords**     |  Enter comma-separated lists of values you want to use with your decoy honeytoken names.  For example, `key,prod,dev`.  Values must be alphanumeric only.   |
    |**Secrets**     |   Enter comma-separated lists of values you want to use with your decoy honeytoken secrets.  For example, `secret,secretProd,secretDev`. Values must be alphanumeric only.    |
    |**Additional HoneyToken Probability**     |  Enter a value between `0` and `1`, such as `0.6`. This value defines the probability of more than one honeytoken being added to the Key Vault.       |


1. Select  **Next: Review + create** to finish installing your solution.

    After the solution is installed, the following items are displayed:

    - A link to your **SOCHTManagement** workbook. You may have modified this name on the **Workbooks** tab earlier in this procedure.

    - The URL for a custom ARM template. You can use this ARM template to deploy an Azure Policy initiative, connected to an Microsoft Defender for Cloud custom recommendation, which distributes the **SOCHTManagement** workbook to key vault owners in your organization.

1. The **Post-deployment Steps** tab notes that you can use the information displayed in the deployment output to distribute the Microsoft Defender for Cloud custom recommendation to all key vault owners in your organization, recommending that they deploy honeytokens in their key vaults.

    Use the custom [ARM template URL](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3a%2f%2faka.ms%2fsentinelhoneytokenspolicy) shown in the installation output to open the linked template's **Custom deployment** page.

    For more information, see [Distribute the SOCHTManagement workbook](#distribute-the-sochtmanagement-workbook).

## Deploy your honeytokens

After you've installed the **Microsoft Sentinel Deception (Honey Tokens)** solution, you're ready to start deploying honeytokens in your key vaults using the steps in the **SOCHTManagement** workbook.

We recommend that you share the **SOCHTManagement** workbook with key vault owners in your organization so that they can create their own honeytokens in their key vaults. You may have renamed this workbook when [installing the solution](#install-the-solution). When sharing, make sure to grant Read permissions only.

**Deploy honeytokens in your key vaults**:

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, go to **Workbooks > My Workbooks** and open the **SOCHTManagement** workbook. You may have modified this name when deploying the solution.

1. Select **View saved workbook** > **Add as trusted**. For example:

    ![Screenshot of the SOCHTManagement workbook 'Add as trusted' button](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/add-as-trusted.png)

    Infrastructure is deployed in your key vaults to allow for the honeytoken deployment.

1. In the workbook's **Key Vault** tab, expand your subscription to view the key vaults ready to deploy honeytokens and any key vaults with honeytokens already deployed.

    In the **Is Monitored by SOC** column, a green checkmark :::image type="icon" source="media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/checkmark.png" border="false"::: indicates that the key vault already has honeytokens. A red x-mark :::image type="icon" source="media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/xmark.png" border="false"::: indicates that the key vault does not yet have honeytokens. For example:

    ![Screenshot of the SOCHTManagement workbooks showing deployed honeytokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/honeytokens-deployed.png)

1. Scroll down on the workbook page and use the instructions and links in the **Take an action** section to deploy honeytokens to all key vaults at scale, or deploy them manually one at a time.

    ## [Deploy at scale](#tab/deploy-at-scale)

    **To deploy honeytokens at scale**:

    1. Select the **Enable user** link to deploy an ARM template that deploys a key vault access policy, granting the user ID specified with rights to create the honeytokens.

        Sign in if prompted, and enter values for the **Project details** and **Instance details** areas for your ARM template deployment. Find your **Tenant ID** and **User object ID** on the Azure Active Directory home page for your users.

        When you're done, select **Review + Create** to deploy the ARM template. For example:

        ![Screenshot of the Custom deployment page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/deploy-arm-template.png)

        Your settings are validated, and when the validation passes, a confirmation is displayed: **Validation Passed**

        At the bottom of the page, select **Create** to deploy your ARM template, and watch for a successful deployment confirmation page.

    1. Back in Microsoft Sentinel, in your **SOCHTManagement** workbook > **Take an action** > **Deploy at scale** area, select the **Click to deploy** link to add honeytokens to all key vaults that you have access to in the selected subscription.

        When complete, your honeytoken deployment results are shown in a table on a new tab.

    1. Make sure to select the **Disable your user** link to remove the access policy that you'd created earlier. Sign in again if prompted, enter values for your custom ARM deployment, and then deploy the ARM template. This step deploys a key vault access policy that removes the user rights to create keys and secrets.

    ## [Deploy a single honeytoken](#tab/deploy-a-single-honeytoken)

    **To deploy a single honeytoken manually**:

    1. In the table at the top of the page, select the key vault where you want to deploy your honeytoken. The **Deploy on a specific key-vault:** section appears at the bottom of the page.

    1. Scroll down, and in the **Honeytoken type** dropdown, select whether you want to create a key or a secret. In the **New honeytoken name** field, enter a meaningful name for your honeytoken. For example:

        ![Screenshot of the deploy on a specific key vault area](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/deploy-manually.png)

    1. In the **Operation** table, expand the **Deploy a honeytoken** section, and select each task name to perform the required steps. Sign in if prompted.

        - Select **Click to validate the key-vault is audited**. In Azure Key Vault, verify that your key vault diagnostic settings are set to send audit events to Log Analytics.
        - Select **Enable your user in the key-vault's policy if missing**. In Azure Key Vault, make sure that your user has access to deploy honeytokens to your required locations. Select **Save** to save any changes.
        - Select **Click to add a honeytoken to the key-vault** to open Azure Key Vault. Add a new honeytoken, like a new secret, to the configured key vault.
        - Select **Click to add monitoring in the SOC**. If successful, a confirmation message is displayed on a new tab: `Honey-token was successfully added to monitored list`.

        For more information, see the [Azure Key Vault documentation](../key-vault/secrets/about-secrets.md).

    > **NOTE** <br>
    > Make sure to select the **Disable back your user in the key-vault's policy if needed** link to remove the access policy created grant rights to create the honeytokens.
    >

    ## [Remove a honeytoken](#tab/remove-a-honeytoken)

    **To remove a specific honeytoken**:

    1. In the table at the top of the page, select the key vault where you want to remove a honeytoken. The **Deploy on a specific key-vault:** section appears at the bottom of the page.

    1. In the **Operation** table, expand the **Remove a honeytoken** section, and select each task name to perform the required steps. Sign in if prompted.

        - Select **Click to delete the honeytoken from the key-vault** to open Azure Key Vault to the page where you can remove your honeytoken.
        - Select **Send an email to update the SOC**. An email is opened in your default email client to the SOC, recommending that they remove honeytoken monitoring for the selected keyvault.

    > **TIP** <br>
    > We recommend that you clearly communicate with your SOC about honeytokens that you delete.
    >

    ---

You may need to wait a few minutes as the data is populated and permissions are updated. Refresh the page to show any updates in your key vault deployment.

## Test the solution functionality

**To test that you get alerted for any access attempted to your honeytokens**:

1. In the Microsoft Sentinel **Watchlists** page, select the **My watchlists** tab, and then select the **HoneyTokens** watchlist.

    Select **View in Log Analytics** to view a list of the current honeytoken values found. In the **Logs** page, the items in your watchlist are automatically extracted for your query. For example:

    ![Screenshot of the honeytokens watchlist values in Log Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/honeytokens-watchlist.png)

    For more information, see [Use Microsoft Sentinel watchlists](watchlists.md).

1. From the list in Log Analytics, choose a honeytoken value to test.

    Then, go to Azure Key Vault, and download the public key or view the secret for your chosen honeytoken.

    For example, select your honeytoken and then select **Download public key**. This action creates a `KeyGet` or `SecretGet` log that triggers an alert in Microsoft Sentinel.

    For more information, see the [Key Vault documentation](../key-vault/index.yml).

1. Back in Microsoft Sentinel, go to the **Incidents** page. You might need to wait five minutes or so, but you should should see a new incident, named for example **HoneyTokens: KeyVault HoneyTokens key accessed**.

    Select the incident to view its details, such as the key operation performed, the user who accessed the honeytoken key, and the name of the compromised key vault.

    > **TIP** <br>
    > Any access or operation with the honeytoken keys and secrets will generate incidents that you can investigate in Microsoft Sentinel. Since there's no reason to actually use honeytoken keys and secrets, any similar activity in your workspace may be malicious and should be investigated.

1. View honeytoken activity in the **HoneyTokensIncident** workbook. In the Microsoft Sentinel **Workbooks** page, search for and open the **HoneyTokensIncident** workbook.

    This workbook displays all honeytoken-related incidents, the related entities, compromised key vaults, key operations performed, and accessed honeytokens.

    Select specific incidents and operations to investigate all related activity further.

## Distribute the SOCHTManagement workbook

We recommend that you deploy honeytokens in as many key vaults as possible to ensure optimal detection abilities in your organization.

However, many SOC teams don't have access to key vaults. To help cover this gap, distribute the **SOCHTManagement** workbook to all key vault owners in your tenant, so that your SOC teams can deploy their own honeytokens. You may have modified the name of this workbook when you [installed the solution](#install-the-solution).

You can always share the direct link to the workbook. Alternately, this procedure describes how to use an ARM template to deploy an Azure Policy initiative, connected to an Microsoft Defender for Cloud custom recommendation, which distributes the **SOCHTManagement** workbook to key vault owners in your organization.

> **NOTE** <br>
> Whenever you distribute the workbook, make sure to grant Read access only.
>

**To distribute the SOCHTManagement workbook via Azure Policy initiative**

1. From the following table, select a **Deploy to Azure** buttons to open the ARM template to the **Custom deployment** page, depending on how you to want to deploy the ARM template.  Use the GitHUb links to view the details of what's included in the ARM template, or to customize the ARM template for your environment.

    The **Deploy to Azure** buttons use the same URLs that are shown on the **Output** tab after the [solution installation](#install-the-solution).

    | Deployment option | Description | Deploy to Azure | GitHub link |
    |-------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
    | Management group | Recommended for enterprise-wide deployment| [![DTA-Button-MG]][DTA-MG]  |[Example in GitHub][GitHub-MG] |
    | Subscription | Recommended for testing in a single subscription | [![DTA-Button-Sub]][DTA-Sub]  | [Example in GitHub][GitHub-Sub] |

    Sign in when prompted.

1. On the ARM template's **Deception Solution Policy Deployment** > **Basics** tab, select your management group value and region. Then, select **Next: Deployment Target >** to continue.

1. On the **Deployment Target** tab, select your management group again, and then select **Next: Management Workbook >**.

1. On the **Management Workbook** tab, paste the link to your **SOCHTManagement** workbook.

    You can find the workbook link from the **SOCHTManagement** workbook in Microsoft Sentinel, and it was also included in the solution deployment's **Output** tab.

    For example, to find the link in the workbook, select  **Workbooks** > **My workbooks** > **SOCHTManagement**, and then select **Copy link** in the toolbar.

1. After entering your workbook link, select **Next: Review + create >** to continue. Wait for a confirmation message that the validation has passed, and then select **Create**.

1. After the deployment is complete, you'll see that the deployment includes a new **HoneyTokens** initiative and two new policies, named **KeyVault HoneyTokens** and **KVReviewTag**. For example:

    ![Screenshot of a successfully deployed ARM template policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/media/monitor-key-vault-honeytokens/policy-deployment.png)

1. In Azure **Policy**, assign the new **KVReviewTag** policy with the scope you need. This assignment adds the **KVReview** tag and a value of **ReviewNeeded** to all key vaults in the selected scope.

    1. In Azure Policy, under **Authoring** on the left, select **Definitions**. Locate your **KVReviewTag** policy row, and select the options menu on the right.

    1. On the **Deploy Diagnostic Settings for Activity Log to Log Analytics workspace** page, enter required values to deploy the diagnostic settings for your environment.

        On the **Remediation** tab, make sure to select the **Create a remediation task** option to apply the tag to existing key vaults.

    For more information, see the [Azure Policy documentation](../governance/policy/assign-policy-portal.md).

1. In **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, add an audit recommendation to all key vaults in the selected scope:

    1. Select **Regulatory compliance > Manage compliance policies**, and then select your scope.

    1. In the details page for the selected scope, scroll down and in the **Your custom initatives** section, select **Add custom initiative**.

    1. In the **HoneyTokens** initiative row, select **Add**.

An audit recommendation, with a link to the **SOCHTManagement** workbook, is added to all key vaults in the selected scope. You may have modified the name of this workbook [when installing the solution](#install-the-solution).

For more information, see the [Microsoft Defender for Cloud documentation](/azure/security-center/security-center-recommendations).

## Known issues:
1.	If you have Azure firewall enabled, you should approve the IP of the function app that is being deployed with the solution. (You can choose to set a static IP)

    See [IP addresses in Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/ip-addresses?tabs=portal) to find the IP of the function.

2.	After some non-active time, the function app might switch to sleeping mode. To keep it always on, you can go to the function app > configuration and set “always on” to ‘On’.

3.	Sometime the LogicApp HoneyTokensAdd2WLKV shows an error on the API connection. To fix this you should manually connect it following the steps below:

    a. Delete the existing API

    b. Create a new 'watchlist - add a new watchlist item' node in the same place in the workflow

    c. Connect it with a managed identity

    d. Copy the body from the failing node to this new node
    
    e. Delete the old (failing) node
