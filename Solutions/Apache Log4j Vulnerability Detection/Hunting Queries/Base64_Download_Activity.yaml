description-detailed: |
  'This hunting query will help detect suspicious encoded Base64 obfuscated scripts that attackers use to encode payloads for downloading and executing malicious files.
  This technique is often used by attackers and was recently used  to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in the Log4j component of Apache in order to evade detection and stay persistent in the network.
