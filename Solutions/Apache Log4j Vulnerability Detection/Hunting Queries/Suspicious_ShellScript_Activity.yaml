name: Suspicious Shell script detected
description: |
  'This hunting query will help detect post compromise suspicious shell scripts that attackers use for downloading and executing malicious files.
  This technique is often used by attackers and was recently used  to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in the Log4j component of Apache in order to evade detection and stay persistent or for more exploitation in the network.
