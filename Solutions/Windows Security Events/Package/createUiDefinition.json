This solution includes two (2) data connectors to help ingest the logs.\n\r\n1. **Windows Security Events via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting Security Events logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **Security Events via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Security Events logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n<P style=\"color:red\">**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of Windows Security Events via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported.</p>\n\n**Data Connectors:** 2, **Workbooks:** 2, **Analytic Rules:** 20, **Hunting Queries:** 50\n\n[Learn more about Microsoft Sentinel](https://aka.ms/azuresentinel) | [Learn more about Solutions](https://aka.ms/azuresentinelsolutionsdoc)",
