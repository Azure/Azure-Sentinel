name: Uncommon processes - bottom 5%
description: |
  'Query highlights uncommon, rare process runs, to flag new potentially unauthorized binaries in stable environments for potential attack detection.'
description-detailed: |
  'Shows the rarest processes seen running for the first time. (Performs best over longer time ranges - eg 3+ days rather than 24 hours!)
  These new processes could be benign new programs installed on hosts; 
  However, especially in normally stable environments, these new processes could provide an indication of an unauthorized/malicious binary that has been installed and run. 
  Reviewing the wider context of the logon sessions in which these binaries ran can provide a good starting point for identifying possible attacks.'
