name: Commands executed by WMI on new hosts - potential Impacket
description: |
  'Query identifies hosts with WMI command runs, absent in last 7 days and filters for Impacket wmiexec arguments. Impacket filters can be adjusted for targeted hunting.'
description-detailed: |
  'This query looks for hosts where commands are run via WMI, where this has not happened in the preceding 7 days. 
    It also filters to command line arguments associated with Impacket wmiexec. These filters can be adjusted to broaden or narrow hunting as required.'
