name: Suspicious Enumeration using Adfind Tool
description: |
  'Query detects Adfind tool use for domain reconnaissance, regardless of executable name, focusing on DC and ADFS servers, to spot potential adversary activity.'
description-detailed: |
  Attackers can use Adfind which is an administrative tool to gather information about Domain controllers, ADFS Servers. They may also rename executables with other benign tools on the system.
  This query searches for Adfind usage in commandline arguments irrespective of executable name in short span of time. You can limit this query to your DC and ADFS servers.
  Below references talk about suspicious use of Adfind by adversaries.
