## Note

With the default deployment and configuration settings of the playbooks, your Tanium API Key is stored in a secure string workflow parameter. To update your Tanium API Key you must redeploy this playbook.

To allow Tanium API Key updates it is advised to use Azure Key Vault to securely store the Tanium API Key and update this playbook to use the Tanium API Key from the Key Vault instead of the secure string parameter.
