## Overview

The Tanium Workbook contains 20+ visualizations across 5 tabs (Threat Response, Comply, Discover, Microsoft Tooling Health and Patch). Each of these tabs shows examples of insights teams can leverage using Tanium's real-time data.

## Setup Data Flow
To populate that data for the Tanium Workbook you'll need to create connections using the Tanium Connect Module in your Tanium Server.
