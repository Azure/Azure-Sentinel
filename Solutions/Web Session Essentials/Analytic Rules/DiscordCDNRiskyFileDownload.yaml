name: The download of potentially risky files from the Discord Content Delivery Network (CDN) (ASIM Web Session)
description: |
  'This detection mechanism identifies instances where requests are made to Discord CDN addresses for file extensions that are considered risky.
    It triggers when a callout is made to a Discord server that has only been encountered once in your environment. The uniqueness of Discord servers is determined based on the server ID present in the request URL (DiscordServerId in the query).
    Discord CDN has been utilized in numerous campaigns to download additional payloads, highlighting the importance of monitoring such activities.
    The query includes a sample set of popular web script extensions (scriptExtensions), which should be customized to align with the specific requirements of your environment'
