The content in this solution requires one of the product solutions below, as well as any other connector or data source normalized to the [ASIM](https://aka.ms/AboutASIM).\n\n**Prerequisite :-**\n\n Install one or more of the listed solutions, or develop your custom ASIM parsers to unlock the value provided by this solution.\n 1. Palo Alto PAN-OS \n 2. SquidProxy \n 3. Vectra AI Stream \n 4. Zscaler Internet Access \n 5. IIS logs (via LA agent) \n\n**Underlying Microsoft Technologies used:** \n\nThis solution takes a dependency on the following technologies, and some of these dependencies either may be in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) state or might result in additional ingestion or operational costs: \n 1. Product solutions as described above \n 2. Logic app for data summarization\n\n**Recommendation :-**\n\nIt is highly recommended to use the **SummarizeWebSessionData** logic app playbook provided with this solution as it will significantly improve the performance of the Workbook, Analytic rules & Hunting queries.\n\n**Workbooks:** 1, **Analytic Rules:** 15, **Hunting Queries:** 9, **Playbooks:** 1\n\n[Learn more about Microsoft Sentinel](https://aka.ms/azuresentinel) | [Learn more about Solutions](https://aka.ms/azuresentinelsolutionsdoc)",
