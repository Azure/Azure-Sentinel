# Rubrik Ransomware Discovery And VM Recovery

## Summary

TThis playbook interacts with Rubrik Security Cloud to (1) optionally preserve evidence by creating an on-demand snapshot of the object, (2) identify a potential recovery point by scanning backups for specified IOCs, and (3) supporting VM image level recovery.

### Prerequisites

1. The Rubrik Security Cloud data connector should be configured to send appropriate events to Microsoft Sentinel.
2.

3. To perform an IOC scan the IOC YARA rule should be available as a URL.
4. Obtain Teams group id and channel id.
