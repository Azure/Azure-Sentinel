	"Description": "The McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator solution provides the capability to ingest [McAfee ePO](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/epolicy-orchestrator.html) events into Microsoft Sentinel through the syslog. Refer to [documentation](https://docs.mcafee.com/bundle/epolicy-orchestrator-landing/page/GUID-0C40020F-5B7F-4549-B9CC-0E017BC8797F.html) for more information.\n\nThis solution is dependent on the Syslog solution containing the Syslog via AMA connector to collect the logs. The Syslog  solution will be installed as part of this solution installation. \n\n **NOTE**: Microsoft recommends installation of Syslog via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024**. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
