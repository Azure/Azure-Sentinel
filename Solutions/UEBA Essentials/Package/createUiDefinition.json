You'll be able to investigate and search for anomalous activities over UEBA's enriched data, and get inspired to customize queries according to your own use-cases.\n\n**Important :** Some of the queries that are part of this solution, make use of [Built-in Watchlist Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/watchlist-schemas) and will not work unless the corresponding watchlist is created. Other queries may requires changes to match your environment details.\n\n**Hunting Queries:** 30\n\n[Learn more about Microsoft Sentinel](https://aka.ms/azuresentinel) | [Learn more about Solutions](https://aka.ms/azuresentinelsolutionsdoc)",
