	"Description": "The [GitHub](https://github.com/) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables you to easily ingest events and logs from GitHub to Microsoft Sentinel using GitHub audit log API and  webhooks. This enables you to view and analyze this data in your workbooks, query it to create custom alerts, and incorporate it to improve your investigation process, giving you more insight into your platform security.\r\n \r\n **Underlying Microsoft Technologies used:** \r\n \r\n This solution takes a dependency on the following technologies, and some of these dependencies either may be in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) state or might result in additional ingestion or operational costs:\r\n \r\n 1. [Codeless Connector Platform (CCP) (used in GitHub Enterprise Audit Log data connector)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/create-codeless-connector?tabs=deploy-via-arm-template%2Cconnect-via-the-azure-portal) \r\n \r\n 2.
