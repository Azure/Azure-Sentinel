  "Description": "The [Forcepoint CASB](https://www.forcepoint.com/product/casb-cloud-access-security-broker) (Cloud Access Security Broker) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel allows you to automatically export CASB logs and events into Microsoft Sentinel in real-time. This enriches visibility into user activities across locations and cloud applications, enables further correlation with data from Azure workloads and other feeds, and improves monitoring capability with Workbooks inside Microsoft Sentinel. \n\nFor more details about this solution refer to [integration documentation](https://forcepoint.github.io/docs/casb_and_azure_sentinel/). \n\r\n1. **Forcepoint CASB via AMA** -This data connector helps in ingesting Forcepoint CASB logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **Forcepoint CASB via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Forcepoint CASB logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends Installation of Forcepoint CASB via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31.2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported.Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
