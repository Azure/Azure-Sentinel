Register AAD application - For DCR (Data collection rule) to authentiate to ingest data into log analytics, you must use Entra application. 1. [Follow the instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/tutorial-logs-ingestion-portal#create-azure-ad-application) (steps 1-5) to get **AAD Tenant Id**, **AAD Client Id** and **AAD Client Secret**. \n 2.
