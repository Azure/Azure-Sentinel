This integration enables security teams to detect, analyze, and respond to emerging threats by correlating external threat data with internal telemetry. By ingesting enriched threat intelligence into Sentinel, organizations gain visibility into malicious activity, track threat actor tactics, and automate defense mechanisms to mitigate risks proactively.\n\n**Data Connectors:** 1, **Analytic Rules:** 36\n\n[Learn more about Microsoft Sentinel](https://aka.ms/azuresentinel) | [Learn more about Solutions](https://aka.ms/azuresentinelsolutionsdoc)",
