	"Description": "The [Cisco Secure Email Gateway (SEG)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security/index.html) solution provides the capability to ingest [Cisco SEG Consolidated Event Logs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/esa/esa14-0/user_guide/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_14-0/b_ESA_Admin_Guide_12_1_chapter_0100111.html#con_1061902) into Microsoft Sentinel.\n\nThis solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors are about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024**.",
