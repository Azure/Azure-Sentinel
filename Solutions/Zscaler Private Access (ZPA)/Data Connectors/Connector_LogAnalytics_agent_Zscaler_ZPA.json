Refer to [LSS documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/about-log-streaming-service) for detailed information\n1. Configure [Log Receivers](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/configuring-log-receiver). While configuring a Log Receiver, choose **JSON** as **Log Template**.\n2. Download config file [zpa.conf](https://aka.ms/sentinel-ZscalerPrivateAccess-conf) \n\t\twget -v https://aka.ms/sentinel-zscalerprivateaccess-conf -O zpa.conf\n3. Login to the server where you have installed Azure Log Analytics agent.\n4. Copy zpa.conf to the /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/**workspace_id**/conf/omsagent.d/ folder.\n5. Edit zpa.conf as follows:\n\n\t a. specify port which you have set your Zscaler Log Receivers to forward logs to (line 4)\n\n\t b. zpa.conf uses the port **22033** by default. Ensure this port is not being used by any other source on your server\n\n\t c. If you would like to change the default port for **zpa.conf** make sure that it should not get conflict with default AMA agent ports I.e.(For example CEF uses TCP port **25226** or **25224**) \n\n\t d. replace **workspace_id** with real value of your Workspace ID (lines 14,15,16,19)\n5. Save changes and restart the Azure Log Analytics agent for Linux service with the following command:\n\t\tsudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart",
