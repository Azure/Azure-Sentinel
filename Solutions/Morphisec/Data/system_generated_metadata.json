  "Description": "The [Morphisec](https://www.morphisec.com/) solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables you to integrate vital insights from your security products with the Morphisec Data Connector for Microsoft Sentinel and expand your analytical capabilities with search and correlation, threat intelligence, and customized alerts. With a single, cross-product view, you can make real-time, data-backed decisions to protect your most important assets.\n\r\n1. **Morphisec via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting Morphisec logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **Morphisec via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Morphisec logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of Morphisec via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
