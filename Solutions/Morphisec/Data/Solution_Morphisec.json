  "Description": "The [Morphisec](https://www.morphisec.com/) solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables you to integrate vital insights from your security products with the Morphisec Data Connector for Microsoft Sentinel and expand your analytical capabilities with search and correlation, threat intelligence, and customized alerts. With a single, cross-product view, you can make real-time, data-backed decisions to protect your most important assets.\n\r\n This solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation. \n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors are about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024**.",
