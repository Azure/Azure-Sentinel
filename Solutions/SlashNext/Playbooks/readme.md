## Overview

**SlashNext URL Investigation Connector** is based upon its Real-time Phishing Defense (RPD) APIs which are connected to SlashNext real-time threat intelligence database, continuously updated with the latest phishing threats. SlashNext RPD APIs are designed to be very fast and give accurate binary verdict on each enrichment request to ease its integration in any phishing Incident Response (IR) or SOAR environment.

### SlashNext URL Investigation Connector + Playbook Templates

This package contains two sample playbook templates to demonstrate the power and simplicity of SlashNext Logic Apps Connector usage.

* [SlashNext URL Investigation Connector](./Playbook/SlashNextVerdictCustomconnector) - Makes use of the SlashNext Real-time Phishing Defense APIs (URL reputation) for fast, accurate and binary verdicts.
* These two playbook templates leverage SlashNext Logic Apps Connector to achieve following:
    * [Web Access log Assessment](./Playbooks/SlashNextLogAssessment) - Designed to be used for the analysis of different kinds of weblogs which are suspected to contain phishing URLs. The playbook shall extract all the URLs from the weblogs and perform their analysis using SlashNext Logic Apps Connector and create an incident for each unique malicious URL found in the weblogs.
    * [Phishing Incident Investigation](./Playbooks/SlashNextIncident) - Designed to be used for the confirmation of suspicious incidents as malicious or benign. The playbook shall perform the analysis of all URL entities attached to an existing incident using SlashNext Logic Apps Connector and add comment to each malicious incident

You can choose to deploy the whole package (logic apps connector + both playbook templates) or each one separately from its specific folder.
