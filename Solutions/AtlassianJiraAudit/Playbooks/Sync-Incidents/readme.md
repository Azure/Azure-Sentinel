## Implementation
To implement this solution, a few different steps need to be done:
1. Create necessary Service Principals
2. JIRA Configuration
   1. Custom fields
   2. Deploy Automation for JIRA rules (used for sync from JIRA to Microsoft Sentinel)
3. Deploy the Key Vault and add secrets
4. Deploy Azure Logic Apps (4) through ARM deployment
5. Deploy Azure Function for comment sychronization and add the Powershell code (check the Functions)
6. Create Sentinel Automation Rule

## 1. Create Service Principal
The tool requires a service principals for authentication to different services:
* Authentication to Microsoft Entra ID to retrieve user ID's (for assigning incidents in Sentinel)
  
### Microsoft Entra ID Service Principal
This Service Principal needs to have User.Read.All application permissions.
This Service Principal is used in the Logic app 'Sync-AssignedUser.

## 2. JIRA Configuration
### JIRA Custom Fields
#### Introduction
A lot of the Sentinel specific information is stored inside of Custom Fields in JIRA which need to be created.
This document contains an overview of the different custom fields that are used in the Logic Apps.
All Logic Apps need to be updated with the correct ID's of the fields.

#### Custom Fields overview

| **Field Name** | **Field ID** | **Field Type**|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organizations | customfield_10002 | Built-in |
| Sentinel Incident URL | customfield_10144 | Url Field |
| Incident ID | customfield_10145 | Text Field (Single line) |
| Closure Comment | customfield_10146 | Text Field (Multiline) |
| Closure Reason | customfield_10047 | Select List (Single choice) |
| Tenant Name | customfield_10149 | Select List (Single Choice) |
| Created At | customfield_10154 | Date Time Picker |
| Att&ck Tactics | customfield_10155 | Select List (Multiple choices) |
| Affected User | customfield_10158 | Text Field (Multiline) |
| Subscription ID | customfield_10162 | Text Field (Singline) |
| Sentinel Resource Group | customfield_10169 | Text Field (Singline) |
| Sentinel Workspace Name | customfield_10170 | Text Field (Singline) |
| Sentinel Workspace ID | customfield_10172 | Text Field (Singline) |
| Sentinel Incident ID | customfield_10173 | Text Field (Singline) |
| Sentinel Incident ARM ID | customfield_10175 | Text Field (Singline) |

The Att&ck Tactics list contains all Sentinel Tactics.
The Closure Reason contains all valid Sentinel Closure Reasons

### JIRA Automation Rules
In order to synchronize changes from JIRA to Sentinel, Automation for JIRA is used to trigger Logic Apps when certain conditions are met.
Automation for JIRA is an integrated plugin that is free to use for JIRA Service Management.

This document will describe the different automation rules that are necessary to trigger the correct Logic Apps/Functions.

In almost every rule, the step 're-fetch issue data' is used. This will make sure we are using the most up to date information in our Logic Apps.
If you are not using this, you might encouter failures.

Navigate to the project settings, then go to Automation to create rules.

#### Sync Status
This automation rule has a trigger 'Issue Transitioned' and will trigger the Logic App 'Sync-Status'. 
Provide the POST URL of the Logic App in the 'Send Web Request' Step. As webhook data, specify 'issue data'.

#### Sync Assigned User
This automation rule has a trigger 'Issue Assigned' and will trigger the Logic App 'Sync-AssignedUser'. 
Provide the POST URL of the Logic App in the 'Send Web Request' Step. As webhook data, specify 'issue data'.

![Automation Rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/AtlassianJiraAudit/Playbooks/Images/JIRA%20-%20Automation%20-%20Sync%20Assigned%20User.png)

#### Create Link
This automation rule has a trigger 'Issue created' and will trigger the Logic App 'Add-JIRALinkComment'. 
Provide the POST URL of the Logic App in the 'Send Web Request' Step. As webhook data, specify 'issue data'.

![Automation Rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/AtlassianJiraAudit/Playbooks/Images/JIRA%20-%20Automation%20-%20Create%20Link.png)

#### Sync comment
This automation rule will trigger the function app to sync public comments to Microsoft Sentinel.
Provide the POST URL of the Sync Comment Function in the 'Send Web Request' Step. As webhook data, specify 'issue data'.

## 3. Deploy Key Vault
The Key Vault is used to store three secrets:
* One for the Microsoft Entra ID Service Principal
* One for the Microsoft Sentinel Service Principal
* One for the JIRA Secret

Create a new Key Vault or deploy an existing one and add the different secrets to it.
The names will need to be provided when deploying the ARM Templates from the Logic Apps.

Edit the Access Policy and assign 'Secret - Get' permissions to the Key Vault Service Principal.

## 4. Deploy Logic Apps
The solution consists of four different Logic Apps:
* Sync Incidents from Sentinel to JIRA (Sync-Incidents.json)
* Sync status from JIRA to Sentinel (Sync-Status.json)
* Sync assigned user from JIRA to Sentinel (Sync-AssignedUser.json)
* Add a link to the JIRA incident to the Sentinel incident (Add-JiraLinkComment.json)

This will enable a two way synchronization between JIRA and Sentinel. Not all Logic Apps are mandatory, you can deploy the ones your organization needs.

Each Logic App can be deployed using the provided ARM templates.
After deploying the Logic Apps, you can copy the HTTP trigger URLs and paste them in the JIRA Automation Rules.

### Custom Fields Configuration
A lot of JIRA Custom fields are used within these Logic Apps. It's important to create these custom fields in your own JIRA environment and change the correct ID's in the Logic Apps.
For more information about the different custom fields used, please check the JIRA Configuration.

[![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FSolutions%2FAtlassianJiraAudit%2FPlaybooks%2FSync-Incidents%2Fazuredeploy.json)

This Logic App will create a new incident in JIRA when an incident in Sentinel is created.
It uses the 'Incident Trigger' from Sentinel and is triggered by an Automation Rule (see Sentinel Configuration).
This Logic App does the following:
* Retrieve all the incident information
* Retrieve the Tactics in this incident
* Retrieve the details from the Account Entity
* Check which customer this incident is coming from (to add the right organization in JIRA)
* Create JIRA ticket through an API call

It uses two connections:
* One connection to Sentinel through a Managed Identity
* One connection to a Key Vault to retrieve the JIRA API Key (Managed Identity)

In order to correlate the right add the incident in JIRA to the correct Organization, we use a switch and determine the correct organization based on the originate Subscription ID.
Add a case per customer and add the right Subscription ID, Customer name and Organization ID.
If you do not use organizations in JIRA, you can remove the switch.

### Sync status from JIRA to Sentinel

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FSolutions%2FAtlassianJiraAudit%2FPlaybooks%2FSync-Status%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FSolutions%2FAtlassianJiraAudit%2FPlaybooks%2FSync-Status%2Fazuredeploy.json)

This Logic App will change the status in Sentinel when the status has been changed in JIRA.
It uses an HTTP trigger which is triggered from a JIRA Automation Rule.
It's important you use the same closure reason in JIRA as the ones in Sentinel, otherwise the sync will fail.

It uses one connections:
* One connection to Sentinel through a Managed Identity.

### Sync assigned user from JIRA to Sentinel

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FSolutions%2FAtlassianJiraAudit%2FPlaybooks%2FSync-AssignedUser%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FSolutions%2FAtlassianJiraAudit%2FPlaybooks%2FSync-AssignedUser%2Fazuredeploy.json)

When a incident is assigned in JIRA, this will assign the correct user inside of Microsoft Sentinel.
It uses an HTTP trigger which is triggered from a JIRA Automation Rule when the assigned user of an incident is changed.

It will retrieve the client secret for the service principal with permissions to retrieve users in your Microsoft Entra ID. With this, it will query the user and retrieve the Microsoft Entra ID Object ID from that user. Wit this information, we will update the incident in Microsoft Sentinel.

There is a check built-in to make sure that JIRA provides the assigned user. Sometimes it does not and then we don't need to update the incident in Sentinel.
* One connection to Sentinel through a Managed Identity
* One connection to a Key Vault to retrieve the Secret for the Service Principal with Microsoft Entra ID permissions (also configured when deploying the Logic App)

### Add a link to the JIRA incident to the Sentinel incident

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FPlaybooks%2FSync-IncidentsWithJIRA%2FAdd-JiraLinkComment%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FPlaybooks%2FSync-IncidentsWithJIRA%2FAdd-JiraLinkCommnet%2Fazuredeploy.json)

This Logic App will add a URL to the JIRA incident as a comment to the Sentinel Incident.
It uses an HTTP trigger which is triggered from a JIRA Automation Rule.

It will add the link to the JIRA Customer Portal, which enables a customer to view the details of an incident inside JIRA.
It uses one connections:
* One connection to Sentinel through a Managed Identity

## 5. Deploy Azure Function

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FSolutions%2FAtlassianJiraAudit%2FPlaybooks%2FSync-CommentsFunctionApp%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FSolutions%2FAtlassianJiraAudit%2FPlaybooks%2FSync-CommentsFunctionApp%2Fazuredeploy.json)

To sync incident comments from JIRA to Microsoft Sentinel an Azure Function is used. This Function App contains one Powershell Function.
There are two types of comments in JIRA: internal and public comments. This script will only sync the public comments, so that customers don't have access to the internal ones.

The code for this function can be found [in this repository](Sync-Comments/Sync-Comment.ps1).
This Function uses a managed identity to authenticate to the Key Vault.

Either deployment the Function App through the ARM template linked above or deploy a Function app manually and paste the ps1 code

After deployment, configure the parameters in the Powershell file.
* jiraUser => Used for authentication to JIRA
* jiraSecretURL => The URL to the JIRA Secret in our Key Vault
* sentinelSecretURL => The URL to the Sentinel Secret in our Key Vault
* tenantID => Tenant ID for the Sentinel Service Principals
* clientID => Client ID for the Sentinel Service Principal

Enable the Managed Identity (Identity => System Assigned).
Provide 'Secret - Get' permissions to the Function app in the Access Policies of the Key Vault.

## 6. Sentinel Automation Rule
In order to trigger the Logic App that creates incidents in JIRA, we use an Automation Rule in Sentinel.
This will enable us to trigger a Logic App (Playbook) each time an incident is created.

Navigate to your Sentinel workspace and choose 'Automation', after this click 'Create Rule'.
Provide a name for the rule and for conditions choose 'Analytics Rule Name contains All'. This will trigger out Logic app each time an incident is created.
If you only want to sync certain incidents, choose the right condition.

For actions, choose 'Run Playbook' and select the 'Sync-Incidents' Playbook.
