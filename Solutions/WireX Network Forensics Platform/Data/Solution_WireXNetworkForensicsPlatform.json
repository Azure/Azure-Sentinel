  "Description": "The [WireX Systems](https://wirexsystems.com/) solution allows custom dashboards and workflows during forensic investigation integrated with Microsoft Sentinel.\n\r\n1. **WireX Network Forensics Platform via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting WireX Network Forensics Platform logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **WireX Network Forensics Platform via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting WireX Network Forensics Platform logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of WireX Network Forensics Platform via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
