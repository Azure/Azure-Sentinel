name: Azure DevOps Agent Pool Created Then Deleted
description: |
  'As well as adding build agents to an existing pool to execute malicious activity within a pipeline, an attacker could create a complete new agent pool and use this for execution.
  Azure DevOps allows for the creation of agent pools with Azure hosted infrastructure or self-hosted infrastructure. Given the additional customizability of self-hosted agents this   detection focuses on the creation of new self-hosted pools.
  To further reduce false positive rates the detection looks for pools created and deleted relatively quickly (within 7 days by default), as an attacker is likely to remove a malicious pool once used in order to reduce/remove evidence of their activity.'
