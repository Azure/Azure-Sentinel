name: Azure DevOps - Build Deleted After Pipeline Modification
description: |
  'Attackers may delete builds after modifying pipelines to minimize traces. This query spots such deletions within an hour of pipeline changes, aiding in system footprint reduction.'
description_detailed: |
  'An attacker altering pipelines may look to delete builds to reduce the footprint they leave on a system. This query looks for a build for a pipline being deleted within 1 hour of a pipeline being modified. This event may produce false positives but should not be so common that it can't be effectively used as part of hunting.'
