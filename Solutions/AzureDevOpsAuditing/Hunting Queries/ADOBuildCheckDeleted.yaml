name: Azure DevOps - Build Check Deleted
description: |
  'This query searches for removal of build checks from the Azure DevOps pipeline. Removal of build checks are rare and may be indication of build pipeline compromise.'
description_detailed: |
  'Build checks can be built into a pipeline in order to control the release process, these can include things such as the successful passing of certain steps, or an explicit user approval. An attacker who has altered a build process may remove a check to compromised build pipeline. This hunting query simply looks for all check removal events, these should be relatively uncommon. In the output Type shows the type of Check that was removed.'
