name: Azure DevOps - New Agent Pool Created
description: |
  'Compromised agent pools in pipelines can allow build process breaches. While creating agent pools isn't inherently malicious, their infrequent creation makes them notable for Azure DevOps monitoring.'
description_detailed: |
  'Agent Pools provide a valuable resource to build processes. Creating and using a compromised agent pool in a pipeline could allow an attacker to compromise a build process. Whilst the creation of an agent pool itself is not malicious it is unlike to occur so often that it cannot be used as a hunting element when focusing on Azure DevOps activity.'
