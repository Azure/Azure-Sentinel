name: Azure DevOps - Internal Upstream Package Feed Added.
description: |
  'An attacker aiming to insert malicious code into a build process could look to introduce compromised upstream packages into the build process. Looking at internal packages can have a significant false positive rate compared to looking at external feeds so running this as a hunting query at least initially is advised. If an environment has low number of events it can be upgraded to a detection.'
