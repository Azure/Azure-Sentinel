  "Description": "This connector gathers all events generated by ESET software through the central management solution ESET PROTECT (formerly ESET Security Management Center). This includes Anti-Virus detections, Firewall detections but also more advanced EDR detections. For a complete list of events please refer to [the documentation](https://help.eset.com/protect_admin/latest/en-US/events-exported-to-json-format.html).\n\n This solution is dependent on the Syslog solution containing the Syslog via AMA connector to collect the logs. The Syslog solution will be installed as part of this solution installation. \n\n **NOTE**: Microsoft recommends installation of Syslog via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024**. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
