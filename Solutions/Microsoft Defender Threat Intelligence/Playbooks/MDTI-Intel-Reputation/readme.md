# MDTI-Intel-Reputation

## Overview
This playbook uses the [Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/what-is-microsoft-defender-threat-intelligence-defender-ti) Reputation Data to automatically enrich incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel. [Reputation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/reputation-scoring) information provides analyst with a decision as to whether an indicator is considered benign, suspicious or malicious. Analysts can leverage this playbook in order to enrich indicators found within an incident. Each reputation result is contained within a comment and will include detailed scoring information noting why a given indicator is considered suspicious or malicious with links back to the MDTI platform for more information.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have deployed [MDTI-Base](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/Microsoft%20Defender%20Threat%20Intellingence/Playbooks/MDTI-Base/azuredeploy.json) playbook. If you have trouble accessing your account or your credentials contact your account representative or reach out to discussMDTI[@]microsoft.com.
