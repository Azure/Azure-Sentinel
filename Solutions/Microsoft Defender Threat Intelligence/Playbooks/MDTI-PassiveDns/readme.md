# MDTI-Data-PassiveDns

## Overview
This playbook uses the [Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/what-is-microsoft-defender-threat-intelligence-defender-ti) Passive Dns data to automatically enrich incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel. Leverage this playbook in order to enrich your incidents with [Passive Dns ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/data-sets#resolutions) data hosted by the indicators found within the incident. Passive DNS (PDNS) is a system of record that stores DNS resolution data for a given location, record, and timeframe. This historical resolution data set allows users to view which domains resolved to an IP address and vice versa. This data set allows for time-based correlation based on domain or IP overlap. PDNS may enable the identification of previously unknown or newly stood-up threat actor infrastructure. Proactive addition of indicators to blocklists can cut off communication paths before campaigns take place. Users will find A record resolution data within the Resolutions data set tab and will find more types of DNS records in the DNS data set tab.
