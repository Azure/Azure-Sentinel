# MDTI-Data-Reverse-Dns

## Overview
This playbook uses the [Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/what-is-microsoft-defender-threat-intelligence-defender-ti) Passive Dns Reverse data to automatically enrich incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel. Leverage this playbook in order to enrich your incidents with [Passive Dns Reverse ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/data-sets#reverse-dns) data hosted by the indicators found within the incident. While a forward DNS lookup queries the IP address of a certain hostname, a reverse DNS lookup queries a specific hostname of an IP address. This dataset will show similar results as the DNS dataset. Reviewing DNS records can be helpful to identify shared infrastructure used by actors across the domains they own. For example, actor groups tend to use the same nameservers to segment their infrastructure or the same mail exchange servers to administer their command and control.
Our Reverse DNS data includes the following:
- Value: the value of the Reverse DNS record.
- First Seen: a timestamp of the date that we first observed this record on the artifact.
- Last Seen: a timestamp of the date that we first observed this record on the artifact.
- Type: the type of infrastructure associated with the record. Potential options include Mail Servers (MX), text files (TXT), name servers (NS), CNAMES, and Start of Authority (SOA) records.
- Tags: any tags applied to this artifact in the Defender TI system.
## Prerequisites

## Post-Deployment Instructions
After deploying the playbook, you must authorize the connections leveraged.

1. Visit the playbook resource.
2. Under "Development Tools" (located on the left), click "API Connections".
3. Ensure each connection has been authorized.

**Note: If you've deployed the [MDTI-Base](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/Microsoft%20Defender%20Threat%20Intellingence/Playbooks/MDTI-Base/azuredeploy.json) playbook, you will only need to authorize the Microsoft Sentinel connection.**
