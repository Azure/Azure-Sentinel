# MDTI-Data-WebComponents

## Overview
This playbook uses the [Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/what-is-microsoft-defender-threat-intelligence-defender-ti) components data to automatically enrich incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel. Leverage this playbook in order to enrich your incidents with [Webcomponents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/data-sets#components) data hosted by the indicators found within the incident. These components allow a user to understand the makeup of a webpage or the technology and services driving a specific piece of infrastructure. Pivoting on unique components can find actors' infrastructure or other sites that are compromised. Users can also understand if a website might be vulnerable to a specific attack or compromise based on the technologies that it is running.

## Prerequisites
1. This playbook inherits API connections created and established within a base playbook. Ensure you have deployed [MDTI-Base](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/Microsoft%20Defender%20Threat%20Intelligence/Playbooks/MDTI-Base/azuredeploy.json) this playbook. If you have trouble accessing your account or your credentials contact your account representative or reach to discussMDTI[@]microsoft.com.
2. This playbook requires "Microsoft Sentinel Contributor" role to update Incidents.
