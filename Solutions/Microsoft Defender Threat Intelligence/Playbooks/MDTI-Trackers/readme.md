# MDTI-Data-Trackers

## Overview
This playbook uses the [Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/what-is-microsoft-defender-threat-intelligence-defender-ti) Trackers data to automatically enrich incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel. Leverage this playbook in order to enrich your incidents with [Trackers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/data-sets#trackers) data hosted by the indicators found within the incident. Trackers are unique codes or values found within web pages and often used to track user interaction. These codes can be used to correlate a disparate group of websites to a central entity. Often, actors will copy the source code of a victim’s website they are looking to impersonate for a phishing campaign. Seldomly will actors take the time to remove these IDs that allow users to identify these fraudulent sites using Microsoft’s Trackers data set. Actors may also deploy tracker IDs to see how successful their cyber-attack campaigns are. This is similar to marketers when they leverage SEO IDs, such as a Google Analytics Tracker ID, to track the success of their marketing campaign.
