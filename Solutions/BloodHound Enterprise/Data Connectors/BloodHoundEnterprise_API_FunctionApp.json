Download the [Azure Function App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/BloodHound%20Enterprise/Data%20Connectors/bhe-funcapp.zip) file. Extract archive to your local development computer.\n2. Start VS Code. Choose File in the main menu and select Open Folder.\n3. Build the function using the [following instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-other?tabs=go%2Cmacos#compile-the-custom-handler-for-azure) \n4. Select the top level folder from extracted files.\n5. Choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose the **Deploy to function app** button.\nIf you aren't already signed in, choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Azure: Functions** area, choose **Sign in to Azure**\nIf you're already signed in, go to the next step.\n6. Provide the following information at the prompts:\n\n\ta. **Select folder:** Choose a folder from your workspace or browse to one that contains your function app.\n\n\tb. **Select Subscription:** Choose the subscription to use.\n\n\tc. Select **Create new Function App in Azure** (Don't choose the Advanced option)\n\n\td. **Enter a globally unique name for the function app:** Type a name that is valid in a URL path. The name you type is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. (e.g. bloodhoundenterpriseXX).\n\n\te. **Select a runtime:** Choose Custom.\n\n\tf. Select a location for new resources. For better performance and lower costs choose the same [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) where Microsoft Sentinel is located.\n\n7.
