This includes open ports, outdated software, misconfigurations, and exploitable weaknesses linked to known vulnerabilities (CVEs). By ingesting asset-level vulnerability insights into Sentinel, security teams can prioritize remediation based on risk context, correlate exposures with active threat campaigns, and trigger automated responses using analytics rules and playbooks.",
