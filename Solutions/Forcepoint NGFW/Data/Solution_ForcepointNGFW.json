  "Description": "The [Forcepoint NGFW (Next Generation Firewall)](https://www.forcepoint.com/product/ngfw-next-generation-firewall) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel allows you to automatically export user defined Forcepoint NGFW logs into Microsoft Sentinel in real-time. This enriches visibility into user activities recorded by NGFW, enables further correlation with data from Azure workloads and other feeds, and improves monitoring capability with Workbooks inside Microsoft Sentinel.\n\nFor more details about this solution refer to [integration documentation](https://forcepoint.github.io/docs/ngfw_and_azure_sentinel/) \n\nThis solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors were deprecated on **Aug 31, 2024**.",
