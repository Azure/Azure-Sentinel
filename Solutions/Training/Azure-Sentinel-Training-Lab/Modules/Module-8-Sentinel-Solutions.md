#### Prerequisites

This module assumes that you have completed [Module 1](Module-1-Setting-up-the-environment.md), as you will need a Microsoft Sentinel workspace provisioned.

### Exercise 1: Explore the Microsoft Sentinel Content hub

This exercise guides you through the Content Hub catalog.

1. From the Microsoft Sentinel portal, navigate to **Content hub** (under **Content Management**).

### Exercise 2: Deploy content from Content Hub Catalog.

This exercice guides you through installing Standalone content and Solutions from the Content Hub catalog.

#### Task 1: Deploy standalone content items

We're going to look at a few items available standalone in the Content hub.

#### Workspace Usage Report Workbook

Find the Workspace Usage Report workbook.

#### Other useful standalone Workbooks

You can optionally search for, explore and Save these workbooks:
  
| Title                         | Description                                           |
| ------                        | ------                                                |
| **Analytics Health & Audit**  | Displays Sentinel rule execution and health 
| **AMA migration tracker**     | Helps understand how clients are connecting to the workspace
| **Insecure Protocols**        | If monitoring SecurityEvent from Windows hosts, identifies usage of poorly-secured protocols
| **SOC Handbook**              | A structured workbook you can edit to reflect your SOC processes



#### Task 2: Deploy a new Solution

This exercise explains how to install a new solution into your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

1. From the Microsoft Sentinel portal, navigate to **Content hub** under **Content Management**

2. In the search bar, type **dynamics 365 CE**. Select the **Dynamics 365 CE Apps** solution and click **Install**

5. In the Workbooks tab, type the name for your Workbook. Click on **Next**

    ![azsolutions](../Images/azsolutions7.png)

6. Notice the different Analytics Rules that will be added to your workspace. Click **Next**

7. Notice the Hunting Queries included in the solution. Click **Next**

8. Notice the Watchlists included in the solution. Click **Next**

9. A final validation will run. If everything is ok, click on **Create** button. The deployment will kick off and finish in a few seconds.

### Exercise 3: Review and enable deployed artifacts

1. Return to Microsoft Sentinel home page and navigate to **Analytics**, and go the **Rule Templates** tab.

2. Type **Dynamics** in the search box. You should see 16 different analytics rules that look at Dynamics 365 data.

3. Notice that these rules are available as **templates**. In a real-world environment, you would need to create them in order to use them.

4. Navigate to **Workbooks** under Threat Management. Search for Dynamics. Like the analytics rules the workbook exists as a template,. This should be empty unless you have enabled the Dynamics 365 connector.

5. Navigate to **Hunting**,  go to **Queries** tab and search for **dynamics 365**. You should see 2 new queries that use data coming from Dynamics 365.
