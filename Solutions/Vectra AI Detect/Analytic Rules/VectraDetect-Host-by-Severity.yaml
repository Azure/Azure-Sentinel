name: Vectra AI Detect - Suspected Compromised Host
description: |
  'Create an incident when a Host is suspected to be compromised. 
  The higher the severity level is, the more immediate attention it requires as Vectra AI engine is more confident that this is a real threat. 
  Level of severity are: Low, Medium, High, Critical). Recommended configuration is to trigger an alert for at least High and Critical.'
