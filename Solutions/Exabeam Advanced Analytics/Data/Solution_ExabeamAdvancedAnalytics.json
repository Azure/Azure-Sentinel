	"Description": "The [Exabeam](https://www.exabeam.com/) Advanced Analytics data connector provides the capability to ingest [Exabeam Advanced Analytics](https://www.exabeam.com/ueba/advanced-analytics-and-mitre-detect-and-stop-threats/) events into Microsoft Sentinel. Refer to [Exabeam Advanced Analytics documentation](https://docs.exabeam.com/) for more information.\n\n This solution is dependent on the Syslog solution containing the Syslog via AMA connector to collect the logs. The Syslog solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n **NOTE**: Microsoft recommends installation of Syslog via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024**. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
