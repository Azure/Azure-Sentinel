|42Crunch Microsoft Sentinel Connector|APIs are increasingly the number one attack vector for adversaries due to their growing abundance and ease of attack via automated scripts and tools. Most public APIs are under constant attack by skilled human adversaries and growing legions of bots.Well-designed, secure APIs are critical to mitigating the risk of attack, but it is essential to also actively monitor and defend your APIs - the frontline of your perimeter - via direct integration into SIEM and SOCs. Using the 42Crunch Sentinel connector, you can quickly set up Sentinel to start ingesting logs from the 42Crunch micro-API Firewall directly into Log Analytics workspaces. With this integration you can:Create alerts on common API error conditionsEnrich API logs with threat intelligence data (i.e. known bad IPs)Detect attack patterns for common adversarial tools (i.e. Kiterunner)Understand common bot behaviors and evasion techniquesIdentify key trends and patterns across all exposed APIs|API - BOLA|AnalyticsRule|42Crunch API protection against BOLA|Solution|

|Azure DevOps Auditing|The Azure DevOps Auditing solution for Microsoft Sentinel allows monitoring Azure DevOps audit events to enable detection of malicious and/or unauthorized access and modification in the repository or pipelines. The streaming of Azure DevOps Audit logs to Azure Monitor must be configured to start ingesting audit events.Analytic Rules: 18, Hunting Queries: 17|Azure DevOps Pipeline modified by a new user.|AnalyticsRule|There are several potential pipeline steps that could be modified by an attacker to inject malicious code into the build cycle. A likely attacker path is the modification to an existing pipeline that they have access to.  This detection looks for users modifying a pipeline when they have not previously been observed modifying or creating that pipeline before. This query also joins events with data to Azure AD Identity Protection (AAD IdP)  in order to show if the user conducting the action has any associated AAD IdP alerts. You can also choose to filter this detection to only alert when the user also has AAD IdP alerts associated with them.|Solution|
| | |Azure DevOps Pipeline Created and Deleted on the Same Day|AnalyticsRule|An attacker with access to Azure DevOps could create a pipeline to inject artifacts used by other pipelines,  or to create a malicious software build that looks legitimate by using a pipeline that incorporates legitimate elements.  An attacker would also likely want to cover their tracks once conducting such activity. This query looks for Pipelines  created and deleted within the same day, this is unlikely to be legitimate user activity in the majority of cases.|Solution|
| | |New PA, PCA, or PCAS added to Azure DevOps|AnalyticsRule|In order for an attacker to be able to conduct many potential attacks against Azure DevOps they will need to gain elevated permissions.  This detection looks for users being granted key administrative permissions. If the principal of least privilege is applied, the number of  users granted these permissions should be small. Note that permissions can also be granted via Azure AD groups and monitoring of these  should also be conducted.|Solution|
| | |Azure DevOps Build Variable Modified by New User.|AnalyticsRule|Variables can be configured and used at any stage of the build process in Azure DevOps to inject values. An attacker with the required permissions could modify  or add to these variables to conduct malicious activity such as changing paths or remote endpoints called during the build. As variables are often changed by users,  just detecting these changes would have a high false positive rate. This detection looks for modifications to variable groups where that user has not been observed  modifying them before.|Solution|
| | |Azure DevOps Variable Secret Not Secured|AnalyticsRule|Credentials used in the build process may be stored as Azure DevOps variables. To secure these variables they should be stored in KeyVault or marked as Secrets.  This detection looks for new variables added with names that suggest they are credentials but where they are not set as Secrets or stored in KeyVault.|Solution|
| | |New Agent Added to Pool by New User or Added to a New OS Type.|AnalyticsRule|As seen in attacks such as SolarWinds attackers can look to subvert a build process by controlling build servers. Azure DevOps uses agent pools to execute pipeline tasks.  An attacker could insert compromised agents that they control into the pools in order to execute malicious code. This query looks for users adding agents to pools they have  not added agents to before, or adding agents to a pool of an OS that has not been added to that pool before. This detection has potential for false positives so has a  configurable allow list to allow for certain users to be excluded from the logic.|Solution|
| | |Azure DevOps Pull Request Policy Bypassing - Historic allow list|AnalyticsRule|This detection builds an allow list of historic PR policy bypasses and compares to recent history, flagging pull request bypasses that are not manually in the allow list and not historically included in the allow list.|Solution|
| | |Azure DevOps Audit Stream Disabled|AnalyticsRule|Azure DevOps allow for audit logs to be streamed to external storage solutions such as SIEM solutions. An attacker looking to hide malicious Azure DevOps activity from defenders may look to disable data streams  before conducting activity and then re-enabling the stream after (so as not to raise data threshold-based alarms). Looking for disabled audit streams can identify this activity, and due to the nature of the action  its unlikely to have a high false positive rate.|Solution|
| | |Azure DevOps Service Connection Addition/Abuse - Historic allow list|AnalyticsRule|This detection builds an allow list of historic service connection use by Builds and Releases and compares to recent history, flagging growth of service connection use which are not manually included in the allow list and not historically included in the allow list Build/Release runs.  This is to determine if someone is hijacking a build/release and adding many service connections in order to abuse or dump credentials from service connections.|Solution|
| | |Azure DevOps PAT used with Browser.|AnalyticsRule|Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are used as an alternate password to authenticate into Azure DevOps. PATs are intended for programmatic access use in code or applications.  This can be prone to attacker theft if not adequately secured. This query looks for the use of a PAT in authentication but from a User Agent indicating a browser.  This should not be normal activity and could be an indicator of an attacker using a stolen PAT.|Solution|
| | |Azure DevOps Retention Reduced|AnalyticsRule|AzureDevOps retains items such as run records and produced artifacts for a configurable amount of time. An attacker looking to reduce the footprint left by their malicious activity may look to reduce the retention time for artifacts and runs. This query will look for where retention has been reduced to the minimum level - 1, or reduced by more than half.|Solution|
| | |NRT Azure DevOps Audit Stream Disabled|AnalyticsRule|Azure DevOps allow for audit logs to be streamed to external storage solutions such as SIEM solutions. An attacker looking to hide malicious Azure DevOps activity from defenders may look to disable data streams   before conducting activity and then re-enabling the stream after (so as not to raise data threshold-based alarms).

| | |Azure DevOps Agent Pool Created Then Deleted|AnalyticsRule|As well as adding build agents to an existing pool to execute malicious activity within a pipeline, an attacker could create a complete new agent pool and use this for execution. Azure DevOps allows for the creation of agent pools with Azure hosted infrastructure or self-hosted infrastructure. Given the additional customizability of self-hosted agents this  detection focuses on the creation of new self-hosted pools. To further reduce false positive rates the detection looks for pools created and deleted relatively quickly (within 7 days by default),  as an attacker is likely to remove a malicious pool once used in order to reduce/remove evidence of their activity.|Solution|
| | |External Upstream Source Added to Azure DevOps Feed|AnalyticsRule|The detection looks for new external sources added to an Azure DevOps feed. An allow list can be customized to explicitly allow known good sources.  An attacker could look to add a malicious feed in order to inject malicious packages into a build pipeline.|Solution|
| | |Azure DevOps New Extension Added|AnalyticsRule|Extensions add additional features to Azure DevOps. An attacker could use a malicious extension to conduct malicious activity.  This query looks for new extensions that are not from a configurable list of approved publishers.|Solution|
| | |Azure DevOps Service Connection Abuse|AnalyticsRule|Flags builds/releases that use a large number of service connections if they aren't manually in the allow list.

| | |Possible AiTM Phishing Attempt Against Azure AD|AnalyticsRule|Threat actors may attempt to phish users in order to hijack a users sign-in session, and skip the authentication process even if the user had enabled multifactor authentication (MFA) by stealing and replaying stolen credentials and session cookies. This detection looks for successful Azure AD sign ins that had a high risk profile, indicating it had suspicious characteristics such as an unusual location, ISP, user agent, or use of anonymizer services. It then looks for a network connection to the IP address that made the sign in immediately before the sign in, that may indicate a user connecting to a phishing site at that IP address and having their authentication session hijacked.

| | |SSH - Potential Brute Force|AnalyticsRule|Identifies an IP address that had 15 failed attempts to sign in via SSH in a 4 hour block during a 24 hour time period.  Please note that entity mapping for arrays is not supported, so when there is a single value in an array, we will pull that  value from the array as a single string to populate the entity to support entity mapping features within Sentinel. Additionally,  if the array is multivalued, we will input a string to indicate this with a unique hash so that matching will not occur.  As an example - ComputerList is an array that we check for a single value and write that into the HostName field for use in   the entity mapping within Sentinel.|Solution|

This value (0xf090013d) seems to only link back to this specific persistence method.  The blog post linked here (https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-execution/forcing-iexplore.exe-to-load-a-malicious-dll-via-com-abuse) provides more background on the meaning of this value.|Solution|
| | |Disable or Modify Windows Defender|AnalyticsRule|This detection watches the commandline logs for known commands that are used to disable the Defender AV. This is based on research performed by @olafhartong on a large sample of malware for varying purposes.  Note that this detection is imperfect and is only meant to serve as basis for building a more resilient detection rule.  Make the detection more resilient, currently the order of parameters matters. You don't want that for a production rule.  See blogpost (https://medium.com/falconforce/falconfriday-av-manipulation-0xff0e-67ed4387f9ab?source=friends_link&sk=3c7c499797bbb4d74879e102ef3ecf8f)  for more resilience considerations.

The email contains a link which points to a website that eventually  presents the user a download of an MS Office document. This document contains a malicious macro. The macro triggers one of the ASR rules.  This detection looks for Office ASR violations triggered by an Office document opened from a browser. Note: be aware that you need to have the proper ASR rules enabled for this detection to work.|Solution|
| | |Hijack Execution Flow - DLL Side-Loading|AnalyticsRule|This detection tries to identify all DLLs loaded by "high integrity" processes and cross-checks the DLL paths against FileCreate/FileModify events of the same DLL by a medium integrity process.  Of course, we need to do some magic to filter out false positives as much as possible. So any FileCreate/FileModify done by "NT Authoriy\System" and the "RID 500" users aren't interesting.  Also, we only want to see the FileCreate/FileModify actions which are performed with a default or limited token elevation. If done with a full elevated token, the user is apparently admin already.|Solution|
| | |Rename System Utilities|AnalyticsRule|Attackers often use LOLBINs that are renamed to avoid detection rules that are based on filenames. This rule detects renamed LOLBINs by first searching for all the known SHA1 hashes of the LOLBINs in your DeviceProcessEvents. This list is then used as reference to find other files executed which have a name that doesn't match the original filename.  This query is really heavy on resources. Use it with care.|Solution|
| | |Expired access credentials being used in Azure|AnalyticsRule|This query searches for logins with an expired access credential (for example an expired cookie). It then matches the IP address from which the expired credential access occurred with the IP addresses of successful logins. If there are logins with expired credentials, but no successful logins from an IP, this might indicate an attacker has copied the authentication cookie and is re-using it on another machine.|Solution|
| | |Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution|AnalyticsRule|This detection looks at process executions - in some cases with specific command line attributes to filter a lot of common noise.|Solution|
| | |Suspicious parentprocess relationship - Office child processes.|AnalyticsRule|The attacker sends a spearphishing email to a user. The email contains a link, which points to a website that eventually  presents the user a download of an MS Office document. This document contains a malicious macro. The macro spawns a new child process providing initial access.  This detection looks for suspicious parent-process chains starting with a browser which spawns an Office application which spawns something else.|Solution|
| | |Beacon Traffic Based on Common User Agents Visiting Limited Number of Domains|AnalyticsRule|This query searches web proxy logs for a specific type of beaconing behavior by joining a number of sources together:  - Traffic by actual web browsers - by looking at traffic generated by a UserAgent that looks like a browser and is used by multiple users to visit a large number of domains. - Users that make requests using one of these actual browsers, but only to a small set of domains, none of which are common domains. - The traffic is beacon-like; meaning that it occurs during many different hours of the day (i.e. periodic).|Solution|

| | |Access Token Manipulation - Create Process with Token|AnalyticsRule|This query detects the use of the 'runas' command and checks whether the account used to elevate privileges isn't the user's own admin account.  Additionally, it will match this event to the logon events - to check whether it has been successful as well as augment the event with the new SID.|Solution|
| | |SMB/Windows Admin Shares|AnalyticsRule|This query is based on detecting incoming RPC/TCP on the SCM, followed by the start of a child process of services.exe. Remotely interacting with the SCM triggers the RPC/TCP traffic on services.exe, and the creation of the child processes is a result of starting the service.  The query might look intimidating given its size. That's why we've commented the query per logic block to walk you through the details.|Solution|

| | |Excessive share permissions|AnalyticsRule|The query searches for event 5143, which is triggered when a share is created or changed and includes de share permissions. First it checks to see if this is a whitelisted share for the system (e.g. domaincontroller netlogon, printserver print$ etc.). The share permissions are then checked against 'allow' rule (A) for a number of well known overly permissive groups, like all users, guests, authenticated users etc. If these are found, an alert is raised so the share creation may be audited. Note: this rule only checks for changed permissions, to prevent repeat alerts if for example a comment is changed, but the permissions are not altered.|Solution|

|Semperis Directory Services Protector|If your hybrid AD isn't secure, nothing is.  Business applications on-premises and in the cloud rely on Active Directory and Azure Active Directory, making it a critical piece of your IT infrastructure. But securing Active Directory is difficult given its constant flux, sheer number of settings, and increasingly sophisticated threat landscape. Securing a hybrid system brings additional challenges as many attacks start on-premises and move to the cloud. Semperis Directory Services Protector (DSP) continuously monitors Active Directory and Azure Active Directory for indicators of exposure and provides a single view of activities on-prem and in the cloud.  Proactively protect AD and Azure AD from cyberattacks with Semperis Directory Services Protector  Catch AD and Azure AD vulnerabilities before attackers do -- attackers are getting better by the minute at targeting soft spots in your hybrid AD system, exploiting weaknesses in on-premises AD to enter the environment, then moving online to Azure AD.   DSP continuously monitors for indicators of exposure and compromiseΓÇöuncovered by the Semperis threat research teamΓÇö that threaten AD and Azure AD.  Eliminate blind spots in hybrid Active Directory security ΓÇô Attackers use powerful hacking and discovery tools to create backdoors and establish persistent access inside of hybrid Active DirectoryΓÇöavoiding detection by traditional SIEM solutions.  DSP uses multiple data sourcesΓÇöincluding the AD replication streamΓÇöto capture changes that evade agent-based or log-based detection. The DSP solution for Microsoft Sentinel expands the sight of Microsoft Sentinel to include previously hidden AD security data.  Enable rapid recovery ΓÇô Intruders and rogue administrators can rapidly wreak havoc across your systems on a scale that is difficult to monitor and remediate effectively with human intervention.
