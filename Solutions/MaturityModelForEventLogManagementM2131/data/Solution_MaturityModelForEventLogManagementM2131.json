  "Description": "This solution is designed to enable Cloud Architects, Security Engineers, and Governance Risk Compliance Professionals to increase visibility before, during, and after a cybersecurity incident. The solution includes (1) workbook, (4) hunting queries, (8) analytics rules, and (3) playbooks providing a comprehensive approach to design, build, monitoring, and response in logging architectures. Information from logs on information systems1 (for both on-premises systems and connections hosted by third parties, such as cloud services providers (CSPs) is invaluable in the detection, investigation, and remediation of cyber threats. Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, directs decisive action to improve the Federal Governmentâ€™s investigative and remediation capabilities. This memorandum was developed in accordance with and addresses the requirements in section 8 of the Executive Order for logging, log retention, and log management, with a focus on ensuring centralized access and visibility for the highest-level enterprise security operations center (SOC) of each agency. In addition, this memorandum establishes requirements for agencies3 to increase the sharing of such information, as needed and appropriate, to accelerate incident response efforts and to enable more effective defense of Federal information and executive branch departments and agencies.
