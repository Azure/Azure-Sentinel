The CUSTOMER Security Operations Center organization will continuously work throughout the Incident Response process as a core component of conducting security monitoring and analysis. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe IR process describes the activities conducted throughout each response phase. The IR process enables the SOC to transition from each phase in an operationally sound manner, involving analysis, triage, case management, and escalation and ultimately engaging the CUSTOMER Incident Response Team (CUSTOMER -IRT) upon critical/urgent incidents which may impact the business and operations of the Organization, or Business Areas/Units.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Purpose\\r\\nThe purpose of this process is to provide the SOC Analysts with detailed procedures for the handling of all events or incidents that occur within the CUSTOMER Enterprise. Incidents can be categorized as one of the following:\\r\\n - Any malicious event (hack, leak, breach, compromise, etc.) to IP, PII, confidential data, digital assets, or any element of the network or the digital assets that can be accessed by it. \\r\\n - Any violation of security or corporate policy by anyone granted legitimate access including vendors, partners, full-time employee (FTE), contingent staffing groups (CSG), guests, interns, contractors, etc. \\r\\n - Any malicious event resulting in loss or compromise to any IP, PII, confidential data, digital assets or the network (or anything connected to it) caused by anyone granted access to that asset, or who gained access to it through a malicious act (virus, malware, hack, breach, worm, etc.). The daily process and procedures executed by the SOC with this IR process demonstrates how the organization addresses and manages security incidents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Incident Response Decision Matrix\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n| IR Decision Matrix |\\r\\n| - | - | - | - | - |\\r\\n| Category | Description | Single Workstation | Multiple Workstations / Single HVT / Single HRT | Multiple HVTs / Multiple HRTs |\\r\\n| Reconnaissance | This category involves the initial communications from a source (external or internal) to a target host.  Common examples of this traffic is scanning activity.  | SEV-3 | SEV-3 | SEV-3 |\\r\\n| Attack/Delivery | This category involves the delivery/transmission of malware.  For example Phishing, USB Drives, websites hosting malicious content, etc. | SEV-3 | SEV-2 | SEV-1 |\\r\\n| Host Exploitation | This category involves the possibility or probability than an attempt to deliver malware was successful.  For example AV, IDS, or other security tools events. | SEV-3 | SEV-2 | SEV-1 |\\r\\n| Binary Installation | This involves advanced attack vectors not monitored by conventional security tools.  For example, additional registry settings, increasing or unidentified windows processes, security tools services terminated, and etc. | SEV-3 | SEV-3 | SEV-2 |\\r\\n| C2 | This category involves an internal device possibly beaconing out to a control server.  For example firewall logs indicating attempts from internal devices to IP’s identified as currently or at some point in the past, identified with malware. | SEV-3 | SEV-2 | SEV-1 |\\r\\n| Local Compromise | This category involves the creation of local accounts, privilege escalation, compromise of existing local accounts, unapproved changes made to group policies, unapproved permission changes for file and folder access, and the use of common command line tools in Windows and Unix. | SEV-2 | SEV-2 | SEV-1 |\\r\\n| Internal Recon | This category involves a compromised host profiling the network for other vulnerable targets which may suggest the use of active security tools such as netcat or is possibly a vulnerability scanner. | SEV-2 | SEV-2 | SEV-1 |\\r\\n| Lateral Movement | This category involves the movement from the compromised host to other hosts.  Examples in this area look for such events like net login, remote registry, remote WMI communications, remote group policy editor and remote session communications such as file share access, RDP, SSH, HTTP. | SEV-2 | SEV-2 | SEV-1 |\\r\\n| Established Persistence | This category includes any activity that attackers may use to maintain their presence on a compromised network.  Examples of this behavior are newly spawned communication services between internal hosts, such as HTTPS, between servers that should not provide this service; common unknown processes being found on multiple hosts; and new binaries being added to the compromised host. | SEV-2 | SEV-2 | SEV-1 |\\r\\n| Stage & Exfiltration | This category involves an attacker taking active steps to steal and exfiltrate data.  Examples of this activity are spikes in normal network traffic, or any other anomalous traffic that deviates from expected network traffic. | SEV-2 | SEV-2 | SEV-1 |\\r\\n| Business Process | This category involves health events, testing, misconfigured devices, normal business ops. etc. | SEV-4 | SEV-4 | SEV-4 |\\r\\n| Policy Violation | This category involves user behaviors associated with Policy Violations. | SEV-4 | SEV-4 |SEV-4 |\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Scope\\r\\nThis process applies to all incidents that are presented to all SOC Analysts and also applies to the CUSTOMER's Incident Response Team tasked with monitoring, response and escalation.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Definitions\\r\\n\\r\\n- A <strong>Security Event</strong> is a change in the everyday operations of an asset/device (i.e. workstation, or server), network or information technology service, indicating that a security policy may have been violated or a security safeguard may have failed. \\r\\n- A <strong>Security Alert</strong> is a correlation of Security Events together that identify a Security Risk.\\r\\n- A <strong>Security Incident</strong> is defined as a series of events that may compromise the integrity of a large number of systems, multiple organizational zones or networks resulting in catastrophic data loss, prolonged organizational downtime, or major financial impact.\\r\\n- A <strong>High-Value Target (HVT)</strong> is a person or asset that an attacker/intruder is attempting to exploit for person gain.\\r\\n\\t- Assets which may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII), Intellectual Property (IP), Application and/or Development Source Code/Builds, or Electronic Transactions such as Credit Cards, or Stock trades. \\r\\n\\t- Persons who may have business/company plans such as future acquisitions, new or emerging products/services, competitive product or service pricing and licensing.\\r\\nThe objective of the SOC is to prioritize events where the High Value Assets are either the target or the source of the alert to conduct further analysis and investigation.\\r\\n- <strong>Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</strong> is defined as any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity,such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. PII data can be sensitive or non-sensitive.\\r\\n- <strong>Payment Card Industry (PCI)</strong>PCI can be described as a set of security standards that were developed to protect card information during and after a financial transaction.\\r\\n- <strong>Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)</strong> compliance is best defined as legislation that was passed by the U.S. Congress to protect shareholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent practices in the enterprise, as well as improve the accuracy of corporate disclosures.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Severity Definitions\\r\\n\\r\\n| Severity 1 (Critical) |\\r\\n| - | - |\\r\\n|   | <strong>Critical Compromise, Major Service disruption or publicly displayed attack</strong> |\\r\\n|   | - Mission critical systems that support multiple businesses (systems defined as mission critical per Ops/Tech) OR sectors of the critical infrastructure (systems defined as Tier 0 for BCP/DR purposes) <br> - CUSTOMER has experienced a substantial loss of service and/or revenue <br> - Prevents CUSTOMER from making sales, or meeting legal or contractual obligations <br> - Potential regulatory fines or penalties <br> - Critical business impact to the company;

The SOC should have preparatory measures to ensure that they can respond effectively to security events/incidents. All documentation should be updated/maintained in the SOC Knowledge Base (Wiki, OneNote).\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommended actions include:\\r\\n- Maintain Contact information for team members and others within and outside the organization (primary and backup contacts)\\r\\n- Maintain escalation procedures (phone numbers & email addresses)\\r\\n- Assist with maintaining IRT documentation\\r\\n- Have a War Room available\\r\\n \\r\\n### Watch / Monitor Phase (Detection)\\r\\nThe SOC group should strive to detect and validate security events and incidents rapidly because infections can spread through an organization within a matter of minutes. Early detection can help an organization minimize the number of infected systems, which will lessen the magnitude of the recovery effort and the amount of damage the organization sustains.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTART --> Create / Monitor Microsoft Sentinel Livestream --> Elevate Livestream to Analytic/Detection --> Fires Alert and Creates an Incident\\r\\n\\r\\n![Watch and Monitor](https://github.com/rinure-msft/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/docs/Watch_and_Monitor.png?raw=true)\\r\\n\\t \\r\\n### Investigation Phase \\r\\nA SOC Analyst needs to determine what action to take based on Incidents observed within Microsoft Sentinel. Triage is the process of evaluating multiple events to determine which are the most critical and prioritizing your response based on this analysis. This procedure will result in one of the listed response actions.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Investigate](https://github.com/rinure-msft/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/docs/IncidentTraigeWorkflow.png?raw=true)\\r\\n\\t \\r\\n#### Determine Category Type & Action Needed\\r\\nThe SOC Analyst should apply the decision matrix below using the Category Type and asset priority. This is used in conjunction with the SOC Response Procedures for the rule triggered. The severities defined below are based on adaptations from the CUSTOMER Company Threat Matrix. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Analysts also need to note the following:\\r\\n- If there is a fast spreading new worm or virus do an immediate callout and include SOC management \\r\\n- If any security device (FW, IDS/IPS sensor, Web Proxy) fails, notify engineers via Remedy for instructions. \\r\\n- If traffic appears to be part of a vulnerability scan or penetration test, check the Vulnerability Scan Scheduling page for verification.\\r\\n\\t \\r\\n### Initiate Action\\r\\nThe Analysts should initiate appropriate response action based on the outcome of the decision matrix above. If any particular Alert/Incident is dismissed, Analysts should follow Microsoft Sentinel's Incident Procedures.\\r\\n- <strong>SEV-1</strong> = Annotate the Incident/Alert and initiate the Critical Call out Procedures with a response time requirement of 15 minutes.\\r\\n- <strong>SEV-2</strong> = Annotate the Incident/Alert and initiate the Urgent Call out Procedures with a response time requirement of 30 minutes.\\r\\n- <strong>SEV-3</strong> = Annotate Incident/Alert. Work Incident internally, if a callout is needed promote case to a SEV-2. Microsoft Sentinel Incidents created will be under the Incident schema\\r\\n- <strong>SEV-4</strong> = Annotate Incident/Alert. Low priority, work internally, if callout is necessary, promote case to a SEV-2. \\r\\n\\t\\t \\r\\nOnce the SOC Analysts suspects a security event or an incident is occurring or has occurred and has been deemed actionable, it is important to immediately begin documentation of all facts related to that event. Every task completed from initial identification of an event until final resolution, should be documented in detail and time-stamped. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\nThe SOC will open an Microsoft Sentinel Incident in the Microsoft Sentinel Incident Blade. At a minimum, the following should be documented in this case: \\r\\n- Current Status of the Alert/Events or the incident\\r\\n- Type of Alerts/Events or Incident (e.g., disruption of service, malicious code, unauthorized access, inappropriate usage) \\r\\n- Full name of the Analyst (will retain case ownership) \\r\\n- Summary of the event or incident\\r\\n- Contact information for all involved parties (e.g., system owners, system administrators) \\r\\n- List of all pertinent logs and technical information gathered \\r\\n- Cause of the event / incident (e.g., misconfigured application, unpatched host) \\r\\n- Business impact of the event\\r\\n- Actions Taken by all SOC Analyst(s) or Incident Response Team\\r\\n- Contact Information for Other Teams Involved \\r\\n- Notes/Comments from other Incident Handlers \\r\\n- Next Steps/Actions to be Taken (e.g., Waiting for system to be re-imaged, waiting for system patch to be applied to vulnerable system) \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n#### Incident Information\\r\\nIt has been identified that a standard set of incident related data fields need to be collected for each incident. This will not only facilitate more effective and consistent incident handling, but also assist the organization in meeting applicable incident reporting requirements. The list below provides information to be collected for all incidents. These are not intended to be comprehensive, and more/less information will be collected based on the specific context of the incident.  \\r\\nIncident Details\\r\\n- Log of actions taken by all handlers \\r\\n- Date/time (including time zone) when the incident was discovered \\r\\n- Estimated date/time (including time zone) when the incident started \\r\\n- Type of incident (e.g., denial of service, malicious code, unauthorized access, inappropriate usage) \\r\\n- Physical location of the incident (if known) \\r\\n- Source/cause of the incident (if known), including hostnames and IP addresses \\r\\n- Description of the incident (e.g., how it was detected, what occurred) \\r\\n- Operating system, version, patch level and installed software \\r\\n- Documentation of all gaps identified during the incident handling. For instance, missing asset information, delivery time of supportive departments, etc. \\r\\n- Endpoint Threat Protection installed, enabled, and up-to-date (yes/no) \\r\\n- Description of affected resources (e.g., networks, hosts, applications, data), including systems’ hostnames, IP addresses, and business function \\r\\n- Estimated technical impact of the incident (e.g., data deleted, system crashed, application unavailable) \\r\\n- Response actions performed (e.g., shut off host, disconnect host from network) \\r\\n- Other organizations contacted (e.g., software vendor) \\r\\n- If any PII was compromised during the incident, what type of PII was it? \\r\\n- Do the affected systems contain any sensitive data (i.e. PII, PCI or SOX)?\\r\\n\\r\\nSigns of an incident that can be categorized as indicators and precursors. \\r\\n- Precursors are signs that an incident may occur in the future.\\r\\n- A threat from a hacktivist group stating the group will attack CUSTOMER or CUSTOMER’s customers \\r\\n\\t- An announcement of a new exploit that targets vulnerable CUSTOMER's servers \\r\\n\\t- Web server log entries revealing unauthorized Web vulnerability scanning \\r\\n\\t- Upcoming termination of a CUSTOMER's employee or contingent worker \\r\\n- Indicators are signs that an incident may have occurred or is actively occurring. \\r\\n\\t- Network IDS/IPS sensor alerts when a buffer overflow attempt occurs against an CUSTOMER server \\r\\n\\t- Endpoint Threat Protection software alerts after detecting malware on a host \\r\\n\\t- Web Server crashes \\r\\n\\t- User complaints regarding poor network connectivity \\r\\n\\t- System Administrator identifies suspicious executable on a CUSTOMER server \\r\\n- Business Criticality: This analysis will consider potential financial, brand, customer and service impact as the primary criteria for incident prioritization. \\r\\n\\t- Considerations: \\r\\n\\t\\t- What is the business purpose of each of the systems that are involved in the incident, attacker and target? \\r\\n\\t\\t- Do these systems host a business critical application or are they in the same network zone with systems that are business critical? \\r\\n\\t\\t- Do the involved systems store or transmit PCI or PII data?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Continue to Monitor Activity\\r\\nIf necessary, initiate the Focused Monitoring procedures in support of other teams. Using the Focus Monitoring Procedure to initiate a LiveStream to watch for ongoing Alerts or Events as they occure.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n### Document Activity in the Shift Log\\r\\nDocument all activity (including false positives) in the Shift Log using the Shift Log Management guidelines.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Follow Up on Activity\\r\\nEnsure that the appropriate response action is fully executed and the ticketing and closure procedures are completed.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the SOC, several metrics are reported weekly to management.  As part of this process service level objectives must be defined, measured and reported.  A service level objective (SLO) is a key element of a service level agreement (SLA) between a service provider and a customer. While incidents may vary in the length of time needed to resolve, there are several metrics that can be defined.\\r\\n\\r\\n### General goals:\\r\\nEvent annotation – All SOC Analysts will review every Incident in the Incident Blade within Microsoft Sentinel within 15 minutes of the Alert/Incident receipt time during normal business hours.  All events from off hours will be analyzed within 4 hours of an analyst coming on duty.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Incident management goals:\\r\\nIncident Triage – All Incidents in \\\"Open or Active\\\" in the Incidents blade of Microsoft Sentinel will be triaged within 15 minutes of them being created and moved into the Secondary Analyst structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestigations will be started on all Incidents within the following times based off of their priority: (All times are assuming business hours)\\r\\n- <strong>Severity 1: Immediately</strong>\\r\\n- <strong>Severity 2: Within 10 minutes of triage</strong>\\r\\n- <strong>Severity 3: Within 60 minutes of triage</strong>\\r\\n- <strong>Severity 4: Within 24 hours of triage</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Remediation SLOs\\r\\n\\r\\n| Incident Severity Table |\\r\\n| - | - | - |\\r\\n| Description |\\tScope |\\tSystem Criticality |\\r\\n| Severity 1 – Critical | Pervasive | Critical |\\r\\n| Severity 2 - Major | Wide | High |\\r\\n| Severity 3 – Moderate\\t| Significant |\\tMedium |\\r\\n| Severity 4 – Minor | Narrow | Low |\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n- <strong>Severity 1 (SEV-1)</strong> – A Severity 1 Incident is worked as the matter of highest Severity until completely resolved. These cases are often handled with a war room response and can require a round the clock response. \\r\\n- <strong>Severity 2 (SEV-2)</strong> – A Severity 2 Incident is worked as a matter of high Severity until completely resolved. These are handled at any time of the day or night as they are detected or reported, but after initial triage may be delayed until business hours if appropriate. \\r\\n- <strong>Severity 3 (SEV-3)</strong> – A Severity 3 Incident is worked urgently during business hours until resolved. \\r\\n- <strong>Severity 4 (SEV-4)</strong> – A Severity 4 Incident is worked best effort on business days until resolved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Notification SLOs\\r\\n\\r\\n| Severity | Who | When | How |\\r\\n| - | - | - | - |\\r\\n| Sev-1 | - ALL SOC Analysts <br> - IR Team <br> - SOC Manager <br> - Director of IT Security <br> - CISO | <strong>First Notification:</strong> Immediately <br> <strong>Subsequent notifications:</strong> 15 minutes or as announced | Teams <br> Teams / Phone & Encrypt Email <br> Teams / Phone & Encrypt Email <br> Encrypted Email <br> Teams WarRoom / Phone|\\r\\n| Sev-2 | - ALL SOC Analysts <br> - IR Team <br> - SOC Manager | <strong>First Notification:</strong> 10 Minutes <br> <strong>Subsequent notifications:</strong> 30 minutes or as announced | Teams <br> Teams <br> Teams |\\r\\n| Sev-3 | - ALL SOC Analysts <br> - SOC Manager | <strong>First Notification:</strong> 60 minutes <br> <strong>Subsequent notifications:</strong> Daily or as announced | Teams <br> Teams |\\r\\n| Sev-4 | - ALL SOC Analysts | <strong>First Notification:</strong> 24 Hrs <br> <strong>Subsequent notifications:</strong> Daily or as announced | Teams |\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Dependencies within the Organization\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to identify other groups within this organization that may be needed to participate in incident handling so that their cooperation can be solicited before it is needed. Every incident response team relies on the expertise, judgment, and abilities of others, including:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Management: Management invariably plays a pivotal role in incident response. In the most fundamental sense, management establishes incident response policy, budget, and staffing. Ultimately, management is held responsible for coordinating incident response among various stakeholders, minimizing damage, and reporting. Without management support, an incident response team is unlikely to be successful. \\r\\n- Cyber Security: Members of the information security team are often the first to recognize that an incident has occurred or is occurring and may perform the initial analysis of incidents. In addition, information security staff members may be needed during other stages of incident handling—for example, altering network security controls (e.g., firewall rules) to contain an incident. \\r\\n- IT Support: IT technical experts (e.g., system administrators, network administrators, and software developers) not only have the needed technical skills to assist during an incident but also usually have the best understanding of the technology with which they deal on a daily basis. This understanding can facilitate decisions such as whether to disconnect an attacked system from the network.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Additional IR Phases\\r\\n\\r\\n### Mobilize\\r\\nDuring the Mobilize phase, the CUSTOMER Security Operations Center will engage the SOC Manager, the Incident Manager and members of the Incident Response Team (Level 3) if a critical incident or any event that has been escalated from all SOC Analysts that has occurred. Additionally, they will provide all of the pertinent information that was gained from the previous phases. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe SOC-IM will reassess the severity/criticality of the incident prior to mobilization of the IRT. The SOC-IM will own and manage the incident moving forward. First, the SOC-IM will prepare an incident summary to inform the IRT and the senior management team that an incident has occurred and that the IR plan has been enacted. \\r\\n\\r\\nNext, the SOC-IM will determine whether additional information or coordination with external teams is required. If all information gathered confirms the occurrence of a high severity incident, then the SOC-IM will notify the IRT and open a communications line to coordinate efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn incident response team is typically composed of the SOC-IM and IRT; IT operations, network operations, business stakeholders, and executive management. In some instances, legal and public relations (PR) organizations will also collaborate as necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Mobilize](https://github.com/rinure-msft/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/docs/Mobilize.png?raw=true)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Assessment and Containment\\r\\n\\r\\nAn incident may need to be contained and/or quarantined to keep it from spreading and to prevent further damage or loss from occurring. During this phase, efforts should be taken to keep potential evidence intact, while balancing the need of the system owner and the incident investigator. In some cases, it may be necessary to either remove the system from the attacker’s ability to access it, or to contain it in some way that is not detectable. Failure in this regard can result in serious damage to the system and related infrastructure as the attacker recognizes the actions you are taking. It is important to consider that some attacks may cause additional damage when contained and/or quarantined, so the SOC should not assume that because a host has been removed from the network, further damage to the host has been prevented.\\r\\n- Containment Considerations:\\r\\n\\t- Is the incident currently on-going? \\r\\n\\t- What is the business impact?\\r\\n\\t- Is stolen information stored on the compromised system? If so this system may be monitored by the attacker and there may be automated routines to delete evidence which would likely destroy the system. \\r\\n\\t- What is the production impact if you pull the network cable or remove the system from production status? \\r\\n\\t- Does the containment strategy affect our ability to preserve evidence? \\r\\n\\t- What effect does the strategy have on service availability (e.g., network connectivity, services provided to external parties)? \\r\\n\\t- What amount of time and resources are needed to implement the strategy? \\r\\n\\t- What is the effectiveness of the strategy (e.g., partial containment, full containment)?\\r\\n\\t- What is the duration of the solution (e.g., emergency workaround, temporary workaround, permanent solution)?\\r\\n\\r\\n![Assess and Contain](https://github.com/rinure-msft/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/docs/Assess_and_Contain.png?raw=true)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n## Technical Root Cause Analysis \\r\\n\\r\\n### Purpose: \\r\\nThe purpose of the technical root cause analysis is to determine the mechanism of attack, the modus operandi (M.O.) of the attacker and the extent of the compromise within the CUSTOMER Enterprise. \\r\\n- Task 1 - Gather all technical information needed to research the details of the incident. \\r\\n\\t- Potential Technical Information to Review:\\r\\n\\t\\t- Operating system logs (Windows/*NIX)\\r\\n\\t\\t- Firewall logs \\r\\n\\t\\t- Router logs \\r\\n\\t\\t- Application logs \\r\\n\\t\\t- Proxy logs\\r\\n\\t\\t- IDS/IPS logs\\r\\n\\t\\t- Endpoint Threat Protection logs\\r\\n\\t\\t- DLP logs\\r\\n\\t\\t- The image of any virtual servers \\r\\n\\t\\t- Network packet captures \\r\\n\\t\\t- Any other information as discovered in the course of the investigation. \\r\\n\\t- Obtain digital evidence from Windows Systems \\r\\n\\t- Obtain digital evidence from Unix/Linux Systems  \\r\\n- Task 2 - Conduct a thorough technical review of collected technical information to determine the mechanism of the attack. \\r\\n\\t- Analyzing Unknown Binaries with Bit9 and/or Carbon Black \\r\\n\\t- Conducting Basic Static/Dynamic Malware Analysis with a known good Sandbox\\t \\r\\n- Task 3 - Review of the sequence and context of the attack to understand the Modus Operandi of the attacker. \\r\\n- Task 4 - Review peer and similar systems to identify if more systems involved in the incident. \\r\\n- Task 5 - Identify and document any systemic weaknesses observed within the CUSTOMER Enterprise network.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Remediation & Recovery\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce an incident has been contained and/or quarantined, it is necessary to eliminate components that allowed the incident to occur, as well as identify and mitigate all vulnerabilities that were exploited. During this phase, it is crucial to identify all affected hosts within the CUSTOMER Enterprise network, so that they can be remediated appropriately.\\r\\n- Task 1 - Complete a peer review of incident details and proposed remediation to ensure consensus on the recommended approach and the details of the attack as documented in the security case. \\r\\n- Task 2 - Conduct a remediation conference call (if needed), to disseminate and discuss recommended and required actions to remediate the incident. \\r\\n- Task 3 - Add all IP addresses and/or host names involved in the incident to the Microsoft Sentinel  compromised and/or hostile WatchList(s) to increase Incident Severity on any subsequent events/alerts detected. This connects directly to the focused monitoring procedures from the SOC team. \\r\\n- Task 4 - Confirm remediation actions have been completed and conduct a final vulnerability assessment of the redeployed system, to prevent reinfection.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the remediation and recovery phase, systems must be restored to normal operation. Depending on the nature of a particular incident, corrective actions could be related to technology, policies and procedures, and/or personnel.\\r\\n\\t \\r\\nDue to the nature of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), multiple attack vectors and the sophisticated nature of cyber-attacks, whereas attackers may leave behind undetected malware, or legitimate executable(s) which may contain a vulnerability or a backdoor on the compromised systems. To combat this threat, the SOC may require the impacted systems to be flattened, formatted,and reinstalled (FFR/wipe and reinstate) to restore the systems trust.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Remediation and Recover](https://github.com/rinure-msft/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/docs/RemediateRecover.png?raw=true)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Remediation Scenarios/Options:\\r\\n- Simple changing of all passwords or removal of infected files. \\r\\n- Minor modification to applicable applications and/or operating system reconfiguration. \\r\\n- System restore from a clean backup.     \\r\\n- Completely rebuilding a system/asset; flattened, formatted, and reinstalled (FFR).\\r\\n \\r\\n#### General Recovery Guidance:\\r\\n- Data should be restored from a trusted source and validated. \\r\\n- The operating system and all applications should be updated wherever possible, patched, and all unnecessary services disabled. \\r\\n- For purpose-built devices (i.e., routers, switches, and security appliances) consult the vendor for information on security conscious configurations. \\r\\n- All system passwords should be changed and hosts with which the compromised system shared a trust relation examined for possible signs of compromise. \\r\\n- If the root cause for the compromise has been determined, appropriate steps should be implemented to mitigate the risks. \\r\\n- Focused Monitoring should be increased following an intrusion. Post compromise monitoring of a network will often reveal additional probes and may help identify additional compromised resources.\\r\\n\\t\\t \\r\\n\\tNote: Remediation & Recovery should be conducted in a phased approach so that remediation steps are prioritized appropriately. During the early phases, the intent should be to increase the security posture with quick, high value changes to prevent future incidents and further outbreaks. The later phases should be focused on long term changes (i.e., infrastructure changes) and ongoing efforts to keep the CUSTOMER Enterprise network as secure as possible. \\r\\n\\t \\r\\n### Post Mortem (Lessons Learned)\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n#### Purpose: \\r\\nOne of the most important parts of the incident management process is also the most often omitted: learning and improving. The CUSTOMER SOC will conduct a “lessons learned” meeting with all involved parties after a major incident, and periodically after lesser incidents. Doing so is extremely helpful in improving security measures and the incident handling process itself. This meeting provides a chance to achieve closure with respect to an incident by reviewing what occurred,what was done to intervene, and how well intervention worked.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Questions to be answered in the lessons learned meeting include: \\r\\n- Exactly what happened, and at what times? \\r\\n- How well did the staff and management perform in dealing with the incident? Were the documented procedures followed? Were they adequate? \\r\\n- What information was needed sooner? \\r\\n- Were any steps or actions taken that might have inhibited the recovery? \\r\\n- What would the staff and management do differently the next time a similar incident occurs? \\r\\n- What corrective actions can prevent similar incidents in the future? \\r\\n- What additional tools or resources are needed to detect, analyze, and mitigate future incidents?\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nIn addition, the SOC will compile a Post Mortem Report. The report shall describe the incident, investigation methods, general conclusion, recommendations to avoid future related incidents and, if appropriate, lessons learned from the investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Post Mortem](https://github.com/rinure-msft/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/docs/PostMortem.png?raw=true)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n#### Recommendations\\r\\n- Small incidents need limited post incident analysis, with the exception of incidents performed through new attack methods that are of widespread concern and interest.\\r\\n- Updating incident response policies and procedures is another important part of the lessons learned process. Postmortem analysis of the way an incident was handled will often reveal a missing step or an inaccuracy in a procedure, providing motivation for change.\\r\\n- The response to an incident that has been resolved can be analyzed to determine how effective it was. The following are examples of performing an objective assessment of an incident: \\r\\n\\t- Reviewing logs, forms, reports, and other incident documentation for adherence to established incident response policies and procedures \\r\\n\\t- Identifying which precursors and indications of the incident were recorded to determine how effectively the incident was logged \\r\\n\\t- Determining if the incident caused damage before it was detected \\r\\n\\t- Determining if the actual cause of the incident was identified \\r\\n\\t- Identifying which measures, if any, could have prevented the incident.\\r\\n\",\"style\":\"upsell\"},\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"SOC Incident Response Procedures\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"name\":\"SOC Incident Response Procedures 1\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# SOC Actions\\r\\n\\r\\nDetected by Microsoft Sentinel\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Suspicious PowerShell Command Line\\r\\n#### Actions to Take:\\r\\n\\t1.

Some of these undesirable applications can replicate and spread from one machine to another. Others are able to receive commands from remote attackers and perform activities associated with cyber-attacks. A malware is considered active if it is found running on the machine or it already has persistence mechanisms in place. Active malware detections are assigned higher severity ratings. Because this malware was not remediated and is active, take precautionary measures and check for residual signs of infection.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Actions to Take:\\r\\n\\t1.

The system stores properties of previous locations used by a user, and considers these \\\"familiar\\\". The risk event is triggered when the sign-in occurs with properties not already in the list of familiar properties. The system has an initial learning period of 30 days, during which it does not flag any new detections. We also run this detection for basic authentication (or legacy protocols). Because these protocols do not have modern properties such as client id, there is limited telemetry to reduce false positives. We recommend our customers to move to modern authentication.

Use Cloud Authentication - In the cloud, we see billions of sign-ins to Microsoft systems every day. Our security detection algorithms allow us to detect and block attacks as they’re happening. Because these are real time detection and protection systems driven from the cloud, they are available only when doing Azure AD authentication in the cloud (including Pass-Through Authentication).\\r\\n\\t2.

If your using ADFS, enable Smart Lockout - https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-ad-fs-extranet-smart-lockout-protection.\\r\\n\\t3. Use Attack Simulator to proactively evaluate your security posture and make adjustments - https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/announcing-the-public-preview-of-attack-simulator-for-office-365/ba-p/162412.\\r\\n\\t4. Work with your Identity Global Admin and Enable MFA. A password is the key to accessing an account, but in a successful password spray attack, the attacker has guessed the correct password. To stop them, we need to use something more than just a password to distinguish between the account owner and the attacker. The three ways to do this are below:\\r\\n\\t\\ta. Risk-based MFA\\r\\n\\t\\tb. Always-on MFA\\r\\n\\t\\tc. Azure MFA as Primary Auth\\r\\n\\t5. NOTE: We strongly recommend enabling always-on multi-factor authentication for all admins in your organization, especially subscription owners and tenant admins. Seriously, go do this right now. For the best experience for the rest of your users, we recommend risk-based multi-factor authentication, which is available with Azure AD Premium P2 licenses. Otherwise, use Azure MFA for cloud authentication and ADFS. In ADFS, upgrade to ADFS on Windows Server 2016 to use Azure MFA as primary authentication, especially for all your extranet access.\\r\\n\\t6. If an Identity has been compromised, escalate and work with your incident response team, or contact Microsoft support for forensic analysis and remediation services.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Anonymous IP Address\\r\\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-simulate-risk\\r\\nThis risk event type indicates sign-ins from an anonymous IP address (e.g. Tor browser, anonymizer VPNs). Such IP addresses are commonly used by actors who want to hide their login telemetry (IP address, location, device, etc.) for potentially malicious intent. For more information - https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2016442\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Actions to Take:\\r\\n\\t1. Validate that the IP Address is Malicious.\\r\\n\\t2. Run Playbook Get-IPReputation - This pulls down known malicious info about the IP from Virus Total.\\r\\n\\t3. If no results return, IP is not listed. Validate the login with the User.\\r\\n\\t4. If results from VT are malicious, run VT Query in Sentinel.\\r\\n\\t\\ta. Create a Bookmark, assign entities.\\r\\n\\t\\tb. Attach Bookmark to current Incident.\\r\\n\\t\\tc. Make notes of what known IOC's are associated with the IP Address.\\r\\n\\t5. Validate the login with the User.\\r\\n\\t6. After validation, if the login was malicious, have the user reset their password.\\r\\n\\t7. If an Identity has been compromised, escalate and work with your incident response team, or contact Microsoft support for forensic analysis and remediation services.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Adaptive application control policy violation was audited\\r\\n#### Actions to Take:\\r\\n\\t1. Review the list of applications that were run.\\r\\n\\t2. Review the application control policy that is applied to this machine by visiting the Adaptive Application Controls section in the Azure Security Center portal.\\r\\n\\t3. Review the list of existing rules in each of the rule collections (publisher/path/hash), and identify the rules that have triggered an audit event for the above applications.\\r\\n\\t4. If you have identified a rule that should allow the above applications to run, review the users that ran them.\\r\\n\\t5. In case you wish to allow them and change the application control policy applied to this machine policy group, make sure to add them to the appropriate rules that you have identified in step #3. Otherwise - contact the specific user and escalate this alert for further investigation.\\r\\n\\t6. If the above applications are not currently allowed by one of the rules that you have identified in step #3, and in case that you wish to allow them, make sure to add a new rule to this machine policy group.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Suspicious authentication activity\\r\\n#### Actions to Take:\\r\\n\\t1. Validate the login with the User.\\r\\n\\t2. Enforce the use of strong passwords and do not re-use them across multiple resources and services.\\r\\n\\t3. In case this is an Azure Virtual Machine, set up an NSG allow list of only expected IP addresses or ranges. (see https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-nsg/) \\r\\n\\t4. In case this is an Azure Virtual Machine, lock down access to it using network JIT (see https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-just-in-time)\\r\\n\\t5. If an Identity has been compromised, escalate and work with your incident response team, or contact Microsoft support for forensic analysis and remediation services.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Failed SSH Brute Force Attack\\r\\n#### Actions to Take:\\r\\n\\t1. In case this is an Azure virtual machine, add the source IP to NSG block list for 24 hours (see https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-nsg/)\\r\\n\\t2. Use SSH Keys where possible instead of Passwords for SSH Access to your VMs and Linux Machines (see Use SSH keys to connect to Linux VMs - Azure Virtual Machines | Microsoft Docs)\\r\\n\\t3. If you are using Passwords instead of SSH Keys, then enforce the use of strong passwords and do not re-use them across multiple resources and services (see http://windows.microsoft.com/Windows7/Tips-for-creating-strong-passwords-and-passphrases) \\r\\n\\t4. In case this is an Azure virtual machine, Create an allow list for SSH access in NSG (see https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-nsg/)\"},\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"SOC Incident Actions\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"name\":\"SOC Incident Actions\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"## Leverage Microsoft Learn for Role-Based Training for Information Security Professionals in Azure\\r\\n\\r\\n![Image Name](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-to-security-in-azure/media/1-heading.png \\\"Microsoft Learn\\\")\\r\\n\\r\\n### Protect against security threats on Azure\\r\\n![Image Name](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/achievements/review-security-tools-features.svg \\\"Protect against Security Threats on Azure\\\")\\r\\n\\r\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\\\"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/protect-against-security-threats-azure/1-introduction/\\\">Start Here</a>\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 25 min - Module - 8 Units\\r\\nLearn how Azure can help you protect the workloads that you run both in the cloud and in your on-premises datacenter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLearning objectives\\r\\nAfter completing this module, you'll be able to:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Strengthen your security posture and protect against threats by using Azure Security Center.\\r\\n- Collect and act on security data from many different sources by using Microsoft Sentinel.\\r\\n- Store and access sensitive information such as passwords and encryption keys securely in Azure Key Vault.\\r\\n- Manage dedicated physical servers to host your Azure VMs for Windows and Linux by using Azure Dedicated Host.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Cloud-native security operations with Microsoft Sentinel\\r\\n\\r\\nThis learning path describes basic architecture, core capabilities, and primary use cases of its products.

This allows analysts to identify Incidents/Alerts/Events which are not necessarily false positives, but do not need to have new Incidents created or do not need to be added to the existing Incident because the Alerts/Events are repeat Alerts/Events. |\\r\\n| Under Investigation | This stage will be used by SOC Analysts to conduct additional analysis on Incidents/Alerts/Events that were moved out of the Triage Stage. |\\r\\n| False Positive / No Further Action | This stage can be used at any point in the workflow to close an Incident with corresponding Alerts/Events that are either false positives or have completed their lifecycle. |\\r\\n\\r\\n### Microsoft Sentinel Incident Stage Management\\r\\nAll of the Incident stages should be reviewed periodically.  The priority of the Incidents will dictate which needs to be addressed first, so the order listing in this narrative is just for functional purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Microsoft Sentinel Incident Traige Stages\\r\\n\\r\\n| Incident Triage Stages by Tags | Description |\\r\\n| - | - |\\r\\n| Open | If determination is made that an Incident is considered to be actionable, this stage will be used. This stage will be used for tracking of incidents throughout the Incident lifecycle. NOTE: SOC Incidents might want be tied into an external ticketing systems (i.e. Archer) when engaging other teams for escalation and/or remediation. For example, the Archer ticket should be entered into the SOC case so someone can tie the two together in an audit or review. |\\r\\n| Open/Escalated - Awaiting Information | Incidents that have been escalated to an External Team by way of the Incident Response Team. This will allow another set of eyes on a particular Incident or group of Incidents to assist with the investigations process. |\\r\\n| Closed - False Positive | This stage is to be used when and Incident has been deemed a false positive and no further action is required. |\\r\\n| Closed - Remediated | Incidents that have been fully examined and the Analyst has provided remediation. |\\r\\n| Closed - Insufficient Data | Incidents that were closed as a result of insufficient data to support the investigation. These Incidents need further review to understand what data is needed to further support the investigation of these Incidents. |\\r\\n| Closed - No Risk | Incidents that have been identified where there was no risk to the Enterprise. (i.e. misconfigured device, authorized scanning) |\\r\\n| Closed - Other | Incidents that have been closed that don’t match the previously identified closure codes (i.e. FP, Remediated, Insufficient data, etc). |\\r\\n\\r\\n### Incident Triage Process (Primary Analyst)\\r\\n1. An Alert/Incident fires into the Incidents Blade within Microsoft Sentinel.  If there is more than one SOC Primary Analyst triaging, they will select the Incidents they wish to investigate and then change the Incident annotation stage to <strong>“Under Investigation”</strong>. The Incident should then be assigned to the Analyst. The Primary Analyst has 5 - 15 minutes to examine the Incident and determines if the Incident is an ‘Incident of interest’. If the Incident is NOT of interest, then it has been determined to be a false positive. The Analyst shall change the Incident Annotation stage to <strong>\\\"False Positive/No Further Action\\\"</strong>. The Incident is then closed and updates the Daily Shift Log. If content can be created and/or modified to eliminate the false positive that information needs to be submitted to the SIEM engineers as a Content Change Request. If the Microsoft Sentinel content doesn’t need to be modified, a SOC Analyst will note the reason for the false positive (i.e. passwords expire, system misconfiguration, etc.) in the daily shift logs.\\r\\n2. If an Incident has been deemed <strong>“actionable”</strong>, the Primary Analyst will conduct additional analysis and compile more information about the Incident. The Primary Analyst then checks to see if a new Microsoft Sentinel Incident or if an existing Incident needs to be updated. If a new Incident is needed, the Analyst gathers the necessary details, opens an Incident and adds all relevant event(s)/bookmark(s) to the Incident. The Analyst changes the Incident stage to <strong>“Open”</strong>. An Incident should only be opened if the analyst is fairly confident that the event(s) is not a false positive. The Primary Analyst notifies a Secondary Analyst (“off-channel”) via email or Teams or another method that there is an Incident opened and tags that Incident with <strong>“Open”</strong>.\\r\\n3. If the event(s) triaged/hunted and bookmarked are part of an existing Microsoft Sentinel Incident, the Analyst updates the details of that Incident and adds all event(s)/bookmark(s) to the existing Incident. The Incident is then tagged with <strong>“Add to Incident”</strong> stage. The Primary Analyst notifies a Secondary Analyst (“off-channel”) via email that there is an Incident opened and also tags that Incident <strong>“Open”</strong>.  \\r\\n4. Once an Incident is opened, it is the responsibility of the Incident owner/creator to manage the Incident to closure, unless it is escalated to the Secondary Analysts or the Incident Response Team.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n### Secondary Analyst - Investigation Process\\r\\n1. The Secondary Analysts need to routinely filter within the Incidents blade of Microsoft Sentinel for the Incidents Tagged <strong>\\\"Open\\\"</strong> to identify any Incidents that need to be further investigated. Escalations from the Primary Analysts will be sent via Teams to the Secondary Analysts. The Analyst that would be responsible for “Incident ownership” will move the Incident Taggs from <strong>“Open”</strong> to <strong>\\\"Under Investigation\\\"</strong> and assign the Incident to themselves.\\r\\n2. In the event that their investigation leads to a False Positive, the Analyst needs to document within the Incident the conclusion and change the Incident stage to <strong>“Closed – False Positive”</strong>. The Analyst then closes the Incident and transfers the knowledge of their findings to the Primary Analysts. The Secondary Analysts will also update the Shift log(s) with those findings. If content can be created and/or modified to eliminate the false positive that information needs to be submitted to the SIEM engineers as a Content change.\\r\\n3. If the Incident has been determined to be valid and no escalation is required, the Analyst will conduct further analysis and continue resolving the Incident. Once the issue has been remediated the Analysis will update the Incident details and then change the Incident to <strong>“Closed – Remediated”</strong>.\\r\\n4. The Analyst then documents within the Incident the conclusion and changes the Incident tagged stage to <strong>“Closed – Remediated”</strong> (with other appropriate closure notes). The Analyst then closes the Incident and transfers the knowledge of their findings to the Primary Analysts.  The Secondary Analysts will also update the Shift log(s) with their findings.\\r\\n5. If the incident requires escalation, the Analyst proceeds with moving the Incident to the <strong>“Escalated to IR”</strong> by tagging the Incident. A SOC Analyst notifies a member of the Incident Response Team via Teams or Email.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n### Incident Response Team - Triage Process\\r\\n1. The Incident Response Team needs to routinely check the Incidents tagged with “Escalated to IR” within the Microsoft Sentinel Incidents Blade to identify any Incidents that need to be further investigated. Escalations from the Secondary Analysts will be sent via Teams or an email to the Incident Response Team. \\r\\n2. In the event that their investigation leads to a False Positive, the Analyst needs to document within the Incident the conclusion and change the Tagged stage to <strong>“Closed – False Positive”</strong>. The Analyst then closes the Incident and transfers the knowledge of their findings to the Primary & Secondary Analysts and updates the Shift Log(s). If content can be created and/or modified to eliminate the false positive that information needs to be submitted to the SIEM engineers as a Content change.\\r\\n3. If the Incident has been determined to be valid, the Incident Responder determines if External Teams are needed to assist with the investigation. If no other team is needed, then IR proceeds with following the pre-defined Incident Response plan. The IR Team member that is responsible for investigating the incident will declare <strong>“Incident ownership”</strong> and assign the Incident to themselves.\\r\\n4. Once the issue has been remediated, the Analyst then documents within the Incident the conclusion and changes the Incident Tagged stage to <strong>“Closed – Remediated”</strong> (with other appropriate closure notes). The Analyst then closes the Incident and provides a knowledge transfer with their findings to the Primary & Secondary Analysts.  The IR Team will also update the Shift log(s) with their findings.\\r\\n5. If an Incident has been determined to be valid and there is an External Team needed to assist with the investigation, a member of the IR Team re-tags the Case to <strong>“Open - Awaiting Information”</strong>. The IR Team member that is responsible for the investigation will declare “Incident ownership” and assigns the Incident to themselves.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nThe IR Team also identifies which external team the incident needs to be escalated to. After escalation has been established, the necessary team will continue to resolve the incident. Once the issue has been remediated, the Analyst then documents within the Incident the conclusion and re-tags the Incident with the tagged stage of <strong>“Closed – Remediated”</strong> (with other appropriate closure notes). The Analyst then Closes the Incident and provides a knowledge transfer with their findings with the Primary & Secondary Analysts.  The IR Team will also update the Shift log(s) with their findings.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n### Incident Closure Workflow \\r\\n1. Once an Incident is closed, review the details of the Incident, the indicators of compromise, the attack vector and the root cause.\\r\\n2. With the information above, determine if an update is needed to the knowledgebase and update as needed.\\r\\n3. Update the Final Incident, review details with informative knowledge and make sure the Incident has been tag/annotated closed.\\r\\n4. With the information above, determine if content needs to be updated or new content created.\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Incident Triage Workflow & Narrative\"},\"name\":\"Incident Triage Workflow & Narrative Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"## Incident Analysis Procedures\\r\\n\\r\\n### Description\\r\\nThe Incident Analysis procedure is the basic analytical process a SOC Analyst must use to determine if a series of Microsoft Sentinel Incidents are critical, warrant some level of callout, or are insignificant and warrant no action. A Primary Analyst will monitor the Microsoft Sentinel Incident Blade for Incidents tagged with <strong>\\\"Triage\\\"</strong>. The Primary Analyst will monitor for a period of 2 or 4 hours according to the Monitoring Schedule. \\r\\n- A Primary Analyst has 5 - 15 minutes from the time an Incident populates the Microsoft Sentinel Incidents Blade to triage and tag Incidents of interest with the <strong>\\\"Triage\\\"</strong> tag, in accordance with the SOC SLA. SLA tracking is monitored by SOC Leadership. A Secondary Analyst will monitor the Microsoft Sentinel Incidents tagged with <strong>\\\"Triage\\\"</strong>. The Secondary Analyst will monitor for a period of 2 or 4 hours according to the Console Monitoring Schedule. \\r\\n- The Secondary Analyst has an 8-hour SLA to resolve these Incidents. This is so the analyst has sufficient time to review and triage Incidents that merit more in-depth analysis. \\r\\n\\t\\t \\r\\nIt may be necessary to monitor the Incidents blade for additional taggs based on new requirements such as virus outbreaks, new 0-days, etc. This notification will be provided to the Primary SOC Analysts by the SOC Leadership as necessary. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 1: Group Events for Analysis\\r\\nThe Primary Analyst will review all Incidents and tag and triage them as necessary for review or close them. If analysis on any of the Incidents is expected to take longer than 5 - 15 minutes, the Primary Analyst will escalate the Incident(s) with the <strong>\\\"Triage\\\"</strong> tag for review by the Secondary Analyst.\\r\\n\\t \\r\\n### Step 2: Understanding the Attack\\r\\nThe Primary Analyst should gather and understand the full context of the cyber-event. Use a tool like notepad to record the following information (this will be transferred to the event annotation notes):\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Identify Source IP / Destination IP Addresses</strong>\\r\\n- Use Nslookup (Windows DNS), Search <Customer> OneNote, Wiki to identify the asset.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Identify Host/Asset Type</strong>\\r\\n- Workstation or Server\\r\\n- Type - Enterprise, Production or Development\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Identify Accounts</strong>\\r\\n- If a service account?

This can indicate the infection vector (e.g. filename.msg may infer it was via email, C:\\\\Users\\\\jdoe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Temporary Internet Files\\\\ may infer it was via web browser.\\r\\n\\t- Are there mitigation steps required? Did AV successfully \\\"clean\\\" the infection? \\r\\n\\t- Detailed Indicators of Compromise (IoC's) associated with the security event(s)\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Identify if any <Customer's> devices are attempting communications with \\\"malicious IP's\\\"</strong>\\r\\n- Did the host call back to a known bad command and control site?\\r\\n- Identify Network protection (Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Endpoint Threat Protection, Sink Hole, Proxy)\\r\\n- Identify all known vulnerabilities (CVE, AV DAT version, recent exploits, etc.)\\r\\n- All activity with similar Source or Destination address in last 5-30 days \\r\\n- Detailed definitions of relevant signatures\\r\\n- Any correlating information from external sources (immediately known Intel)\\r\\n- Run a KQL to search for both the offending IP/domain and for the specific indicator to see if any other hosts are making similar connection attempts.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t \\r\\n### Step 3: Analyze and Assess the Impact of the Attack\\r\\nThe Analysts should investigate any Attack by using any/all internal and external tools and resources. \\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Additionally, all Analysts should be prepared to answer the following:</strong>\\r\\n- Was the attempt successful?\\r\\n- How many hosts are involved?\\r\\n- Was the IP blocked by the FW or Proxy?\\r\\n- Were any Customers impacted?\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>What was the origin and/or details about the attacker IP?</strong>\\r\\n- WhoIs, Domain tools\\r\\n- Spoofed IP (pcap analysis is required)\\r\\n- Skill of attacker (automated scripts vs. obfuscation attempts)\\r\\n- Country, ISP, Business (what is the net block)\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>What was attacked?</strong>\\r\\n- DMZ\\r\\n- Corporate systems\\r\\n- Database(s)\\r\\n- [CUSTOMER's] Application(s) - Web?\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>What did they do (or try to do)?</strong>\\r\\n- Identify names of IDS signatures or alarms, as well as definitions of the various signatures. \\r\\n- What broad categories do all the events fit in? (Web, OS, Application, SQL, etc...) \\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>When did they do it?</strong>\\r\\n- Identify all date-time-groups (DTG), attack timeline (fast/slow), time of day in source IP time zone. \\r\\n- Identify a series of subtle events or rash of attacks (fast/slow)\\r\\n- Same time of day vs. various times\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Where did they attack from?</strong>\\r\\n- Identify the IP address of attacked system(s), external/internal/DMZ, applications, open ports, vulnerabilities, and usernames (if any). \\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Why did they do it?</strong>\\r\\n- Identify the purpose of the attack. Targeted or random?\\r\\n- Web Defacement\\r\\n- Admin access\\r\\n- Reconnaissance \\r\\n- Dos/DDoS or other outage\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>How did they go about it?</strong>\\r\\n- Identify the tool used (vulnerability scanner, port scanner), hand crafted, type of attack (buffer overflow, SQL injection, format string), protocol used, flags set, or other details. \\r\\n\\t \\r\\n### Step 4: Determine What Action is Needed\\r\\nDepending on the severity of the Incident, an analyst may need to report the Incident in several manners. The outcome of the analysis should prompt the analyst to perform one or more of the following actions. Once one of the below actions are taken, the Incident(s) should be tagged using the appropriate tags as detailed in the Incident Triage Workflow Procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Close Incidents\\r\\n- If the Incident(s) are either false positives or do not warrant further attention, the Incident(s) should be closed.\\r\\n- This may be the case when traffic is blocked by a proxy device or firewall or if the traffic is normal traffic that is triggering false positives.\\r\\n- If an Incident is concluded to be a false positive, a filter request should be completed in the Shift Logs section.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Report Incidents in Shift Logs\\r\\n- If the Incidents should be noted for future analysis or operational meetings, the Incident should be reported in the Shift Logs section.\\r\\n- A shift log entry should be created using the Shift Log Management Procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Escalating Incidents\\r\\n- If the Incidents should be escalated for further analysis by other teams or internal SOC analysts, the Incidents should be escalated per the Incident Triage Procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Creating Incidents\\r\\n- The SOC Analyst has determined that an Alert or series of Alerts/Events appear to be related and warrant further investigation.\\r\\n- Refer to these procedures in order to open a Incident.\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Incident Analysis\"},\"name\":\"Incident Analysis Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"## Information Fusion Procedures\\r\\n\\r\\n### Description\\r\\nThe Information Fusion Procedure is important in that it assures that all SOC Analysts are properly informed of the latest global security threats. \\r\\n\\r\\n### SOC Analyst Procedures\\r\\nAll SOC Analysts should perform the following tasks: \\r\\n- Read current Intelligence Reports. \\r\\n- The Daily Intelligence Report will cover the latest threats, external news and operational news. \\r\\n- Query Microsoft Sentinel for internal events that may correlate with news provided by Intelligence Reports. \\r\\n- Review all news and messages sent via email. \\r\\n- Relay all news of significant events and messages provided by other [Customer]'s Teams via email and update the shift log report. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Sr. SOC Analyst Procedures\\r\\nAll Senior SOC Analysts will create the Daily Intelligence Report, Weekly Intelligence Reports and other reports as defined in the Roles and Responsibilities.

This process applies to all Incidents/Alerts/Events that are presented within the Microsoft Sentinel Incidents Blade. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Process Summary \\r\\nAll SOC Analysts are responsible for detecting significant intrusions and attempts that are missed in standard operational monitoring. A subtle event is an attack that is intentionally crafted to be difficult to detect. These include; unknown signatures, low & slow, IDS evasion, and other attack patterns that are difficult to detect in operational time (5-15 minutes). Operational time is the time frame from the first appearance of an Incident/Alert/Event in the Microsoft Sentinel Incidents Blade until the SOC Analyst clears it, either by tagging it for review or by closing it out. Highly skilled attackers will often conduct attacks that happen over much larger time windows than any individual Incident/Alert/Event will remain through monitoring, thus once operational time is exhausted there exists a set of analytical disciplines that are meant to discover these attacks by looking at larger sets of data. The primary purpose of this process is to discover highly skilled attackers and to recognize patterns of attack that are not widely recognized. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll SOC Analysts are responsible for conducting weekly analysis using Microsoft Sentinel's Hunting Blade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Data Exploration procedure defines the analytical methodologies for SOC Analysts to look at larger security datasets and to conduct exploratory data analysis. This procedure will leverage the Hunting Blade and Hunting KQL Queries provided within Microsoft Sentinel. This procedure documents the mechanics of interacting with large datasets but cannot fully capture the complete analysis process as that is guided by the ingenuity of the individual analyst. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Roles & Responsibilities \\r\\n- SOC Manager owns the successful completion of all daily operational processes and procedures. The SOC manager is also responsible for ensuring these daily operational process effectively support SOC operations and for continuous process improvement. \\r\\n- SOC Analysts executes daily operations procedures as a matter of daily responsibility and owns the successful completion of all procedures executed during his/her presence in the SOC. SOC Analysts own the documentation and measurement of all subordinate procedures as well as the continual improvements to them.  The role of a SOC Analyst is the detailed and repeatable execution of all operational tasks as documented in this process and its subordinate procedures. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n### Additional Processes \\r\\n- Subordinate Procedures \\r\\n\\t- Data Exploration\\r\\n- Related Process & Procedures \\r\\n\\t- Reporting Process \\r\\n\\t- Intrusion Analysis Process \\r\\n\\r\\n### Process Owner's Names \\r\\nSOC Manager \\r\\n\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Subtle Event Process\"},\"name\":\"Subtle Event Process Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"## Data Exploration Procedures\\r\\n\\r\\n### Description \\r\\nThis topic describes the procedures for using Microsoft Sentinel's Hunting Blade to review security events for abnormalities. Data Exploration is concerned with the identification of IOCs that were previously unknown or the hidden within data sets. These IOCs can then be addressed or operationalized for situational awareness.\\r\\nIf you're an investigator who wants to be proactive about looking for security threats, Microsoft Sentinel powerful hunting search and query tools to hunt for security threats across your organization's data sources. But your systems and security appliances generate mountains of data that can be difficult to parse and filter into meaningful events. To help security analysts look proactively for new anomalies that weren't detected by your security apps, Microsoft Sentinel' built-in hunting queries guide you into asking the right questions to find issues in the data you already have on your network.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Hunt for threats\\r\\nWith Microsoft Sentinel hunting, you can take advantage of the following capabilities:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Built-in queries: To get you started, a starting page provides preloaded query examples designed to get you started and get you familiar with the tables and the query language. These built-in hunting queries are developed by Microsoft security researchers on a continuous basis, adding new queries, and fine-tuning existing queries to provide you with an entry point to look for new detections and figure out where to start hunting for the beginnings of new attacks.\\r\\n- Powerful query language with IntelliSense: Built on top of a query language that gives you the flexibility you need to take hunting to the next level.\\r\\n- Create your own bookmarks: During the hunting process, you may come across matches or findings, dashboards, or activities that look unusual or suspicious. In order to mark those items so you can come back to them in the future, use the bookmark functionality. Bookmarks let you save items for later, to be used to create an incident for investigation. For more information about bookmarks, see Use bookmarks in hunting.\\r\\n- Use notebooks to automate investigation: Notebooks are like step-by-step playbooks that you can build to walk through the steps of an investigation and hunt. Notebooks encapsulate all the hunting steps in a reusable playbook that can be shared with others in your organization.\\r\\n- Query the stored data: The data is accessible in tables for you to query. For example, you can query process creation, DNS events, and many other event types.\\r\\n- Links to community: Leverage the power of the greater community to find additional queries and data sources.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Start Hunting\\r\\n1. In the Microsoft Sentinel portal, click Hunting.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n![Start Hunting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/media/tutorial-hunting/hunting-start.png)\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n2. When you open the Hunting page, all the hunting queries are displayed in a single table. The table lists all the queries written by Microsoft team of security analysts as well as any additional query you created or modified. Each query provides a description of what it hunts for, and what kind of data it runs on. These templates are grouped by their various tactics - the icons on the right categorize the type of threat, such as initial access, persistence, and exfiltration. You can filter these hunting query templates using any of the fields. You can save any query to your favorites. By saving a query to your favorites, the query automatically runs each time the Hunting page is accessed. You can create your own hunting query or clone and customize an existing hunting query template.\\r\\n3. Click Run query in the hunting query details page to run any query without leaving the hunting page. The number of matches is displayed within the table. Review the list of hunting queries and their matches. Check out which stage in the kill chain the match is associated with.\\r\\n4. Perform a quick review of the underlying query in the query details pane or click View query result to open the query in Log Analytics. At the bottom, review the matches for the query.\\r\\n5. Click on the row and select Add bookmark to add the rows to be investigated - you can do this for anything that looks suspicious.\\r\\n6. Then, go back to the main Hunting page and click the Bookmarks tab to see all the suspicious activities.\\r\\n7. Select a bookmark and then click Investigate to open the investigation experience. You can filter the bookmarks. For example, if you're investigating a campaign, you can create a tag for the campaign and then filter all the bookmarks based on the campaign.\\r\\n8. After you discovered which hunting query provides high value insights into possible attacks, you can also create custom detection rules based on your query and surface those insights as alerts to your security incident responders.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Additional Context can be found here\\r\\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/hunting\\r\\n\\r\\n### Process Owner's Names \\r\\nSOC Manager \\r\\n\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Data Exploration\"},\"name\":\"Data Exploration Process Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# SOC Use Cases\\r\\n\\r\\n## Description\\r\\nThe [CUSTOMER] Security Operations Center (SOC) is leveraging the SANS: Critical Controls for Effective Cyber Defense Framework & MITRE ATT&CK Framework to provide both a roadmap for future capabilities as well as establishing a reporting standard to drive security awareness and risk management.

These metrics will be used to learn the effectiveness and efficiency of the SOC and will provide tangible documented results that will reveal areas that may require improvement, or areas that are meeting or exceeding goals, objectives and expectations. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of the CUSTOMER SOC Metrics Program is at any given time to communicate to stakeholders the current security posture of the SOC.  This is accomplished with clearly defined objectives, identified stakeholders and/or audiences, and measurable task and processes.  It is also intended to provide insight into general threat and vulnerability trends across the CUSTOMER's enterprise. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Scope \\r\\nThe scope for this Metrics Program is to measure (4) categories defined as Security Awareness, Effectiveness & Efficiency, Technology and Skills & Capabilities.  Security Awareness metrics consist of those measurements that are derived from security systems such as Intrusion Detection Systems, suspicious network communication, endpoint security events, etc.  These metrics will expose the threat landscape and possibly identify gaps of coverage within the infrastructure.  These gaps may be ineffective or lacking processes, technology limitations or unavailable skill sets.\\r\\n\\r\\nEffectiveness and Efficiency metrics are those measurements that are derived from day to day task such as number of events annotated, number of cases opened, false positive events, etc.  These metrics will identify the SOC’s return on investment (ROI) as well as detect what processes are performing as expected and meeting defined targets, and what processes are creating workflow difficulties.  Such difficulties may be the result of ineffective or lacking processes, technology limitations or unavailable skill sets.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology metrics are those measurements that provide insight to the security infrastructure, such as the total number of monitored devices, total number of raw events, system health events, etc.  These metrics define and visualize the volume and scope of monitoring and can identify data choke points, the need to upgrade or modify architecture, reveal onboarding challenges and in conjunction with Effectiveness and Efficiency metrics, predict the probability of man power shortage.  These events are outside of the control or direct influence of the analyst.\\r\\n\\r\\nSkills and Capabilities metrics are those metrics that identify the SOC team’s strengths and weaknesses as defined by the SOC prioritized proficiency targets and roles and responsibilities.  Proficiency targets are various levels of competencies within a skill discipline that are defined by SOC management.  Skill disciplines range from IDS skills, Firewall skills, Communication skills, etc.  These metrics are used to define educational opportunities, may define career development or increase/decrease the SOC’s vision into the enterprise network infrastructure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe technical scope of this process is limited to discrete data and information that can be collected, analyzed and reported on within Microsoft Sentinel or other operational support tools in use by the CUSTOMER's SOC. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Process Summary \\r\\nThe SOC Manager and SOC Operations Lead will work with business and security teams to identify requirements, and the Lead Engineer will implement appropriate measurement to support SOC Operations. Business measurement in the SOC will leverage Microsoft Sentinel and its periodic reporting capabilities. Once a business requirement has been defined, the data sources to be measured will be identified, and the resulting Microsoft Sentinel content (KQL Queries, Watch Lists, Workbooks, Trends, and Spreadsheets) will be developed. All collected measurements will be reviewed periodically as defined in the Process Improvement Process, as well as by each individual process. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three main categories of SOC business measurement; Monthly, Weekly and Daily. These three make up the primary subordinate procedures to this process. These are all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which are metrics of process effectiveness. A good example of a SOC KPI is calculating the number of Incidents per analyst/hour (IPAH). \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also Executive Summary metrics which are for upward reporting. These are generated on a monthly basis and used by the SOC management to give executive visibility into the types of cases the SOC is dealing with and the workload it is under.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Metrics Definition Process \\r\\n- Define business questions to answer (requirements). \\r\\n\\t○ These will be documented and tracked in an appendix to the metrics procedure. \\r\\n\\t○ These will be identified and called-out in each of the documented SOC processes as required. \\r\\n- Identify the data sources needed to answer the requirement. \\r\\n- Analyze the data \\r\\n- Develop appropriate content to capture the data \\r\\n- Review metrics content within an appropriate time frame, as documented in each process. \\r\\n- Incorporate identified improvements. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Metrics \\r\\n- See Subordinate Procedures \\r\\n\\r\\n## Roles & Responsibilities \\r\\n- SOC Manager is responsible for the overall success of this process. The SOC manager ensures that the technology and training is available to support the collection of any data needed for effective business measurement. \\r\\n- Lead Engineer will take the measurement requirements established by the subordinate procedures and implement them with the Microsoft Sentinel environment to support the overall business measurement process. \\r\\n- SOC Lead will work with the SOC Manager to define and document the information requirements and then work with the Microsoft Sentinel Engineer to solution those requirements with Microsoft Sentinel Analytic/WatchList/Workbook/Playbook/Notebook content. \\r\\n- Business Requirement Owner defines a metrics requirement to be satisfied within the Microsoft Sentinel solution and will be responsible to ensure the resulting content is reviewed and leveraged as needed. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Process Linkages \\r\\n- Subordinate Procedures \\r\\n\\t- Monthly Metrics \\r\\n\\t- Weekly Metrics \\r\\n\\t- Daily Metrics\\r\\n\\t- Executive Metrics\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n## Related Process & Procedures \\r\\n- Process Improvement \\r\\n- Reporting Process \\r\\n\\r\\n## Process Owner \\r\\n SOC Manager\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Business Measurement Process (Metrics)\"},\"name\":\"Business Measurement Process (Metrics) Body\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# Process Improvement\\r\\n\\r\\n## Purpose \\r\\nThe purpose of this document is to provide the framework for the [CUSTOMER] Security Operations Center (SOC) Process Improvement program. This process will include a list of procedures associated with the continuous process improvement program; these will leverage the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model for Integration (CMMI). The business goal is to enable the on-going assessment of SOC operations and provide feedback to improve service capability over time. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Scope \\r\\nThis process applies to all process and procedures implemented in the [CUSTOMER] SOC. This process supports the assessment of the current state, suggests improvement areas and specific actions to improve service capabilities. The scope of this process is strictly limited to the [CUSTOMER] SOC. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Process Summary \\r\\nThe SOC Manager and the SOC Operations Lead evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of SOC process and procedure on a biannual basis. They use this information to improve SOC service delivery effectiveness. A continuous improvement process will enable the SOC's service delivery to be consistent, predictable, and on a path of continuous improvement. This is important in the field of security operations to guarantee a standardized, repeatable and high quality-of-service in recognizing and responding to critical information security events. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Process Maturity Procedures will document the detailed steps for continuous process improvements. Given the rapid rate of change in the field of information security, this process will also be supported by an Agile Methodology Procedures to ensure that the SOC can effectively respond to new and emerging information security attacks with iterative and rapidly evolving process and procedures. The Agility procedure will also allow the SOC to become operationally effective much faster than traditional waterfall development methodologies. The Documentation Procedures will establish the methodology for drafting and maintaining appropriate documentation to support maturity and agility objectives. \\r\\n\\r\\n- Perform initial assessment \\r\\n- Score assessment, report maturity level and findings \\r\\n- Identify service maturity goals \\r\\n- Create action plans to achieve goals \\r\\n- Execute service improvements \\r\\n\\t\\r\\nThe [CUSTOMER] SOC will measure process maturity by using the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model for Integration. The CMMI is defined to contain the following levels: \\r\\n\\r\\n| CMMI LEVEL |\\r\\n| - | - |\\r\\n| Level 1 | Ad hoc (Chaotic) |\\r\\n| Level 2 | Repeatable |\\r\\n| Level 3 | Defined |\\r\\n| Level 4 | Managed |\\r\\n| Level 5 | Optimized |\\r\\n\\r\\nThe targeted maturity level for the [CUSTOMER] SOC is Level-3 (Defined): It is characteristic of processes at this level that there are sets of defined and documented standard processes established and subject to some degree of improvement over time. These standard processes are in place (i.e., they are the AS-IS processes) and used to establish consistency of process performance across the organization. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Metrics \\r\\n- Process Maturity Assessment Results (CMMI) \\r\\n\\r\\n## Roles & Responsibilities \\r\\n- SOC Manager is responsible for the overall success of this process.

This procedure should be performed periodically (as needed) and all processes should be reviewed every 180 days. \\r\\nThe next scheduled appraisal is planned for: MMM DD, YYYY. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 1 - Perform Assessments \\r\\n#### Score Maturity \\r\\nThe SOC Appraisals will use the Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPI). Method C will be used for internal appraisals, the SOC leadership team will organize the assessment and an employee external to the SOC [CUSTOMER] will conduct the on-site portions of the assessment.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n#### Appraisal Method \\r\\n##### Planning Phase \\r\\nThe purpose of the planning phase is to review the appraisal methodology (this document) as well as to prepare the logistical aspects for the on-site phase of the appraisal.\\r\\n- Scope Appraisal - While the scope of appraisals will not change from one appraisal to the next, (scope encompasses the entire SOC), a review of any specific goals, specific deadlines, or results reporting changes should be discussed during this step. Any additional decisions to be made by the SOC sponsors and SOC leadership should be made during this phase as to not impact the appraisal process.\\r\\n- Plan Appraisal - Plan appraisal involves development of the appraisal plan, establishing the availability of planned interviewees during the on-site period, planning the logistic requirements of the appraisal (meeting rooms, support staff availability, etc.), establishing the roles of appraisal team members, and verifying the appraisal schedule with all affected parties. It also involves verifying who will receive data upon appraisal conclusion.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n##### Preparation Phase \\r\\nThe purpose of the preparation phase is to prepare the appraisal team for the on-site activities and conduct a preliminary gathering and analysis of data through the Appraisal Record Matrix (*ARM*).\\r\\n- Prepare - Prepare appraisal team involves reviewing the details of the appraisal with the team. The facilitator reviews with the team the SEI-CMMI and appraisal method, appraisal plan, schedule, information regarding the SOC, wiki evidence, goals for the organization, and any additional parameters. Specific responsibilities for each team member are assigned.\\r\\n- Analyze Evidence - The appraisal team analyzes the data gathered in the Appraisal Record Matrix (*ARM*) and determines areas for practice validation, identifies potential discrepancies in responses, and performs a gap analysis against the SEI-CMMI. This process element results in a set of exploratory questions and anticipated responses for use during the project lead interviews (conducted by an assessor external to the SOC). Anticipated responses will be derived from the ARM and used to correlate the interview responses with OneNote procedures and documentation during the onsite phase.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n##### Onsite Phase \\r\\nThe purpose of the onsite phase is to explore the results of the preliminary data analysis, and provide an opportunity for practitioners at the appraised entity to participate in the data gathering and validation process.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n- Interview Practitioners - The interview portion of the appraisal begins with an introductory session with the appraisal participants to review the appraisal process and affirm SOC commitment to the appraisal. Next, the session facilitator introduces the team, explains the purpose of the session, and asks each practitioner the exploratory questions. All referenced documents should be contained on the framework. There is a separate session for each practitioner. This interview typically provides corroborating and clarifying data in relation to the evidence collected (recorded in the Appraisal Record Matrix (*ARM*)).\\r\\n- Analyze Data Tracking Sheet & Develop Preliminary Findings - The appraisal team analyzes the evidence and consolidates the data tracking sheet. The voting members systematically analyze the data from all sources to generate a list of preliminary findings related to the process areas and capability levels under investigation. Finally, this data consolidation step allows the appraisal team to determine any needed changes in the schedule or outstanding elements of the data gathering process.\\r\\n- Compile Findings - Develop final findings involves analyzing the preliminary findings and ARM in light of the contents of the capability levels, determining the estimated process capability for each process area investigated, and consolidating the preliminary findings for presentation to the sponsor.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n##### Reporting Phase \\r\\nThe reporting phase is the concluding phase of the appraisal process in which the team performs its final analysis of all data gathered during the previous three phases and presents its findings to the sponsor.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n- Finalize Scoring & Report Outcomes - Finalize scoring involves synthesizing the Appraisal Record Matrix (*ARM*) into a rating profile. The team reviews notes and achieves consensus on the capability level for each process area. The findings developed during the onsite phase and analysis of the SOC, are presented and explained to the sponsor by the appraisal team.\\r\\n- Manage Appraisal Records - Managing appraisal records involves the proper disposal of all materials gathered and created during the appraisal. Most intermediate work products and inputs will be destroyed while the final ARM, findings, and final report are sent to the sponsor.\\r\\n- Review Results & Report Lessons - Report lessons learned involves synthesizing information about what did and did not work during the appraisal and suggestions for improvement. This step will also incorporate a review of the appraisal results to determine faults in process and potential areas of improvement.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n#### Business Process Metrics \\r\\n- Business Measurement Process (Metrics) - Defines the maturity and process performance measurements. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n#### Appraisal Timeline \\r\\n- The following is the Appraisal Timeline:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 2 - Create Action Plan \\r\\nWithin two weeks of the appraisal, an action plan will be created to address the results of the appraisal. The steps below can be used to create this action plan: \\r\\n- Determine steps needed to address the appraisal results \\r\\n\\t- Interview and observe analysts to validate the as-is conditions. \\r\\n\\t- Brainstorm ideas for improvement, include SOC Analysts and management. \\r\\n\\t- Document improvement plan (evidence of maturity) \\r\\n\\t- Knowledge Base revisions to document the changes implemented for the improvement process. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 3 - Execute Improvements \\r\\nOn the timeline defined by the action plan, improvements will be made to address the results of the appraisal. \\r\\n- Update process documentation in knowledge base \\r\\n\\t- Document changes in the appropriate knowledge base page utilizing the Documentation Procedures. \\r\\n\\t- Communicate changes to stakeholders (SOC Analysts and Management) \\r\\n\\t- Nightly automated knowledge base change e-mails will notify all shifts of the change. \\r\\n\\t- SOC Analyst verbal communication is to be used to reinforce the process changes made in the knowledge base. \\r\\n\\t- Track progress of change implementation, update knowledge base as necessary. \\r\\n\\t- Ensure successful completion by process and procedure review.\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Process Maturity\"},\"name\":\"Process Maturity Body\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# Documentation Standard Procedures\\r\\n\\r\\n## Description\\r\\nThis procedure illustrates the process for creating or updating process and procedure documentation on the SOC Knowledge Base.

Small and mid-size organizations may centralize compliance responsibilities into the SOC while larger organizations may have separate risk and compliance organizations with which the SOC will interoperate and collaborate.  Organizations of all size significantly increase efficiency and transparency by mapping internal processes to specific external regulatory standards that are in scope for the organization (e.g. CMMC, PCI, HIPAA).  Mapping and reporting against a defined international/external standard enables the SOC to dedicate focus on operations and not repeated administrative reporting tasking.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of [CUSTOMER]'s Information Systems Division, the SOC is expected to adhere to and assist with enforcement of all applicable [CUSTOMER]'s Policies. The requisite policies are listed below. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Scope \\r\\nAll SOC Procedures and Personnel are subject to and required to adhere to the [CUSTOMER] IT & security policies. In addition, where applicable, these policies are to be enforced through system and reporting/alerting design. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Procedure Description \\r\\nThe compliance procedure described below is intended to describe the compliance procedures in place within the SOC to adhere to all [CUSTOMER]'s Policies and applicable legal regulations. \\r\\n1. An initial review of the [CUSTOMER] Corporate Policies is to be completed and the Applicable Policies & Standards included in the Applicable Policies & Standards listing below. \\r\\n2. The listing of Applicable Policies & Standards below will be periodically reviewed and updated as defined in the Process Maturity Procedures. \\r\\n\\t- If new policies are released, existing policies are expanded, or the Procedures of the SOC are updated, the listing of applicable policies should also be updated. \\r\\n\\t- In addition, if any applicable legal regulations are added or expanded to include the standard operations of the SOC, those should also be listed below. \\r\\n3.

Compliance team provides logging & reporting requirements. \\r\\n2. Determine which needs can be met by the SOC Operational Processes. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 2: Identify Data Sources \\r\\nThe second step will also need to be completed with assistance of the data/business owners. \\r\\n1. Develop listing of data sources necessary to meet requirements collected in Step 1. \\r\\n2. Identify system owners that maintain data required to meet the logging/reporting requirements (i.e. platform admins, application admins, DB admins). \\r\\n3. Provide system owners with steps necessary to provide audit/logging information to Microsoft Sentinel Connectors. \\r\\n- Note: If all requirements cannot currently be met with Microsoft Sentinel, notify compliance team and provide alternate recommendations (if available). \\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 3: Add Data Sources to Sentinel \\r\\nThe third step requires support from the system owners & administrators to provide the interfaces necessary for Microsoft Sentinel to collect the required information. \\r\\n1. Coordinate with system owners to supply logging/audit information to Microsoft Sentinel. \\r\\n2. Provide support as necessary (i.e. links to examples or system documentation) if system owners cannot supply the necessary information. \\r\\n3. Once system logs are transmitted to an Microsoft Sentinel, verify that the required field and trace information is available and is being properly indexed in Microsoft Sentinel. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 4: Create Reporting \\r\\n1. From the requirements gathered in Step 1, generate the trends, queries, and reports necessary to meet the reporting criteria. \\r\\n2. Schedule reports as necessary to provide automatic generation and distribution to the compliance teams, SOC, and system owners. \\r\\n3. Most reports will be generated on a regular basis; however, it may be necessary to generate some on an 'on-demand' schedule. These reports should be prepared, but not scheduled for automatic execution or distribution. \\r\\nWork with compliance team and system owners to generate meaningful, useful reports that can aid them with the secure operation of their systems and in meeting the compliance objectives of the organization.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 5: Review and Approve Reporting Contents & Schedule with Compliance Team \\r\\n1. Once reports have been generated, verify with compliance team and system owners that the delivered reports are applicable, meaningful, and useful in meeting the organization's compliance objectives. \\r\\n2. Conduct periodic reviews of compliance reporting (as part of the Process Maturity cycle) to verify that the services and reporting provided to the compliance teams by the SOC are useful.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Compliance Status Matrix\\r\\n\\r\\n|   | SOX | HIPPA - Benefits | HIPPA - PHARMA/Optical | PCI | CMMC | Step Description |\\r\\n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\\r\\n| Assigned | Matt E. | Randal C. | Beth B. | Edward H. | Rin U. |   |\\r\\n| Step 1 Status |   |   |   |   |   | Receive Compliance Requirements |\\r\\n| Step 2 Status |   |   |   |   |   | Identify Data Sources |\\r\\n| Step 3 Status |   |   |   |   |   | Add Data Sources to Microsoft Sentinel |\\r\\n| Step 4 Status |   |   |   |   |   | Enable/Edit or Create Reporting |\\r\\n| Step 5 Status |   |   |   |   |   | Review and Approve Reporting |\\r\\n\\r\\n## Supporting Processes \\r\\n- Related Process & Procedures \\r\\n\\t- Internal Compliance \\r\\n\\t- Process Maturity \\r\\n\\r\\n## Process Owner \\r\\nSOC Manager \\r\\n\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Compliance Support\"},\"name\":\"Compliance Support Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Process\\r\\n\\r\\n## Purpose\\r\\nThe purpose of this document is to provide the framework for [CUSTOMER]'s Security Operations Center (SOC) Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plans.

Since not all rules will create incidents, we can monitor the noisiness of the detections and see which ones require tuning. In the alerts insights section, we provide insights into detections that are not firing and might require attention and track the load from different providers.\\r\\n- Incidents - The load on the SOC is determined by the number of incidents we create. Here we can monitor which detections created incidents and the reasons incidents are closed. When looking at the incident load and the closing reason, we can deduce which detections require attention and tuning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIterating on all 3 views in a repetitive process will improve our detection efficiency, SOC performance, and, ideally, the organization’s detection suite. This continuous process should adapt our detections to the ever-changing security threat landscape.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Analytics Efficiency](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/255498i05BDC150FB36F807/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two ways to access this workbook –\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

the high-level process and supporting detailed procedures for the handling of all Incident's that occur within Microsoft Sentinel. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Scope \\r\\nThis process applies to every Incident/Alert/Events that is displayed on the Microsoft Sentinel Incidents Blade in the [CUSTOMER]'s Security Operations Center (SOC). This process primarily applies to Incidents/Alerts/Events that are tagged with \\\"Triage\\\". \\r\\n\\r\\n## Process Summary \\r\\nAll Assigned SOC Analysts will appropriately manage the lifecycle of Incidents/Alerts/Events within Microsoft Sentinel. An Incident is generated in Microsoft Sentinel monitored security device within the [CUSTOMER] Enterprise. This event has a number of associated meta tags that further classify, prioritize and define it. Microsoft Sentinel is monitored 8x5x365 by the SOC. The on duty SOC Intrusion Analyst applies Intrusion Analysis Procedures to these Incidents to further understand them and then executes one of the Incident Management procedures established under this process. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Triage Procedure \\r\\nThe <strong>Incident Triage Procedure</strong> establishes the responses required for each event by priority and category. This procedure will document items such as category, model confidence, priority and provide a decision matrix that documents appropriate actions. These actions will be; Investigate, Open Problem & Change Ticket, Add to Watch List, Initiate Callout, Open New Incident, or Initiate the Crisis Response Procedure. The triage process will also document the event stages that apply as events are analyzed, triaged and closed. \\r\\n- Incident evaluation \\r\\n\\t- Initial evaluation of correlated events within Incidents \\r\\n- Determine further evaluation or initiate action \\r\\n\\t- Expand data set to include detailed records \\r\\n\\t- Execute discovery tools, if required \\r\\n- Reference triage matrix \\r\\n- Execute action \\r\\n\\r\\n## Callout Procedure \\r\\nThe Callout Procedures defines the step-by-step process to follow in order to notify an Incident Manager or other appropriate escalation point of contact. \\r\\n- Determine appropriate communication method \\r\\n- Reference Triage matrix \\r\\n- Execute action \\r\\n\\t- Follow Escalation path for out-of-criteria cases \\r\\n\\t- Validate completion \\r\\n\\r\\n## Incident Management Procedure \\r\\nThe Incident Management Procedure documents the step-by-step flow involved in the closed-loop management of opened Incidents within Microsoft Sentinel for Incidents/Alerts/events requiring management actions as defined in the Triage Procedures. \\r\\n- Incident Created \\r\\n- Assign Incident\\r\\n- Resolve Incident\\r\\n- Validate Resolution \\r\\n- Close Incident \\r\\n- Assign appropriate disposition \\r\\n\\r\\n## Crisis Response Procedure \\r\\nThe Crisis Response Procedures documents the steps the SOC should take in the event a cyber-crisis situation is recognized. This procedure stands up the Crisis action team as documented in the aforementioned procedure. \\r\\n- SOC initiated \\r\\n\\t- IRT \\r\\n\\t\\t- Network Team \\r\\n\\t\\t- Server Team \\r\\n- SOC supported \\r\\n\\t- IRT \\r\\n\\t\\t- Command Center \\r\\n\\t\\t- Ancillary Teams \\r\\n\\r\\n## Incident Management Process Flow \\r\\nThe Incident Priority Chart is used to determine the priority and urgency of an Incident based on the perceived or actual impact on business functions. For all Incidents/Alerts not defined in the Triage Procedure, use the matrix below to determine the priority and urgency of a new Incident. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\nFor all Incidents determined to be a SEV1 or SEV2 incident, a Crisis Response will be initiated. The Crisis Response Procedure follows the high level chart below. The SOC is responsible for initiating this flow and verifying with the Incident Manager that the problem has been resolved and the Problem Management Process has been initiated. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n## Metrics \\r\\n- Incidents handled per analyst - Personnel KPIs \\r\\n- Incidents per total events handled by analyst - Personnel KPIs \\r\\n- Incidents opened by category by analyst - Personnel KPIs \\r\\n- Incidents opened by severity - Overall KPIs \\r\\n- Incidents per analysts hour - Overall KPIs \\r\\n- Total Incidents by final disposition - Overall KPIs \\r\\n\\r\\n## Roles & Responsibilities \\r\\n- SOC Manager only has high level responsibilities associated with the Incident management process. These are to ensure that appropriate training and resources are provided to the SOC Analysts. \\r\\n- SOC Operations Lead is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and relevance of this process as well as all associated procedures. \\r\\n- SOC Analyst is responsible for the appropriate execution of this process and all associated procedures. The SOC Analyst is responsible for ensuring that any procedure initiated is completed in a closed-loop and well documented manner. \\r\\n- Incident Response Handler is responsible for receiving the appropriate notification and responding in a timely fashion to callouts. The Incident Response Handler is responsible for completing any required investigation and closing the loop with the SOC by closing the opened Incident and informing the SOC of relevant findings for process improvements. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n## Process Owner \\r\\nSOC Manager\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Incident Management Process\"},\"name\":\"Incident Management Process Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# Incident Triage\\r\\n\\r\\n## Description \\r\\nThis procedure describes how a SOC Analyst determines what action to take based on Alert(s)/Incident(s) observed within Microsoft Sentinel.

This page details the steps an Analyst should take in order to create an informed and standardized Incident. Microsoft Sentinel definition: An Microsoft Sentinel Incident is a container for information about a specific Alert(s), usually with one or more Entities, Alerts, and Events attached. An Incident is used to track, investigate, and resolve Alert(s) of interest or a series of raw and correlated events that created an Alert that need further investigation. An Incident should be created any time an analyst is looking into events of interest through a KQL Query.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Microsoft Sentinel Incidents\\r\\n- <strong>SOC Incidents / New</strong>: For newly identified cases before being assigned to the SOC Analysts or the IR team. \\r\\n- <strong>SOC Incidents / Active - SOC Assigned</strong>: For Incidents analysts are working on internally. Only Incidents that are updated daily by a SOC Tier 1/Tier 2 Analyst.\\r\\n- <strong>SOC Incidents / Active - IR Assigned & Tagged</strong>: Used by the Incident Response Team investigators to manage their Incidents.\\r\\n- <strong>SOC Incidents / Active - ExT Assigned & Tagged</strong>: Used by External Team investigators to manage their Incidents. \\r\\n- <strong>SOC Incidents / Closed</strong>: Categories of CLOSED Incidents. \\r\\n\\t- <strong>CLOSED - No Risk</strong>: For events that were added to cases and were determined to be of no risk to the [CUSTOMER] Enterprise.\\r\\n\\t- <strong>CLOSED - Insufficient Data</strong>: For cases that were unable to determine the root cause. Subcategories might be added for more detailed tracking and measurements. \\r\\n\\t- <strong>CLOSED - False Positive</strong>: For cases that were determined to be a false positive. \\r\\n\\t- <strong>CLOSED - Remediated</strong>: For cases with a validated conclusion. Subcategories might be added for more detailed tracking and measurements to improve time to resolution. \\r\\n\\t- <strong>CLOSED - Other</strong>: Cases that have been closed that don’t match the previously identified closure codes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Find an Incident\\r\\n- From the Microsoft Sentinel Menu, Select Incidents. The Incidents page lets you know how many incidents you have, how many are open, how many you've set to In progress, and how many are closed.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Investigate Incidents](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/media/tutorial-investigate-cases/incident-severity.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n- You can filter the incidents as needed, for example by tag, status, or severity.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Incident Tags](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/232940i1CCFD101BCBB19EE/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Procedure \\r\\n### Open an Incident \\r\\n- Determine that an Incident has the appropriate Alerts/Events to investigate (see Incident Triage Procedures) \\r\\n- Add events of interest to the Incident through Bookmarks and attaching them to the Incident.\\r\\n\\t- Create a Bookmark\\r\\n\\t\\t1. In the Azure portal, navigate to Sentinel > Logs and execute the desired KQL query.\\r\\n\\t\\t2. From the log query results list, use the checkboxes to select one or more rows that contain the information you find interesting.\\r\\n\\t\\t3.

A SOC Analyst should initiate the Crisis Response procedures for any event that is likely to cause major impact to the organization. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 1 - Gather Information\\r\\nThe first step a SOC Analyst should do in response to a perceived crisis situation is to gather basic information about the attack. \\r\\nImportant information includes: \\r\\n- Source IP Addresses \\r\\n- Destination IP Addresses \\r\\n- Time of Attack \\r\\n- Context and Depth of Attack \\r\\n- Estimated Impact \\r\\n\\t\\r\\nIt is very unlikely all information in a Crisis situation will be immediately present, but it is important that the SOC Analyst understand a basic scope of the attack/crisis before engaging another team. <strong>It is critical that all steps taken be documented in the shift log as the steps are being taken.</strong> During a crisis, the Primary Analyst (on-console) will remain on console for the remainder of the shift or until the crisis is remediated. A SOC Analyst that is not on console will be responsible for all communication efforts if a Senior SOC Analyst is not present and would assist the SOC Analyst if present. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 2 - Escalate Events and Notify Teams \\r\\nOnce an Incident with Alerts/Events or series of Alerts/Events are recognized as a crisis, a Senior Analyst should be contacted immediately. If a Senior Analyst cannot be reached, the SOC Analyst should contact SOC Management. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n<strong>SOC Management</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the situation has been discussed with a Senior Analyst/Manager, a callout to other teams should occur to begin the mitigation process. The SOC should be the central hub of communication during a crisis. <strong>The Incident Responder on-call member should be notified in all crisis situations.</strong>\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nHere is a sample listing of teams to involve in different crisis situations. Every crisis situation is unique and must be handled in the manner most likely to resolve the crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\n| Crisis | Teams |\\r\\n| - | - |\\r\\n| Virus/Worm Outbreak |\\tCommand Center, Helpdesk Team |\\r\\n| Network Intrusion | Network Team |\\r\\n| 10+ Server Compromise | Server Team, Network Team |\\r\\n| Effective DDoS Attack | Command Center, Network Team |\\r\\n| Outbound Attack on Sensitive Networks (gov, .mil, .cn) | Network Team |\\r\\n| Serious Impact to Business Processes | Command Center, Network Team, Server Team |\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nContact Emails: SOC Contacts \\r\\nPage will contain: \\r\\n- Brief description of incident \\r\\n- SOC telephone number \\r\\n\\t\\r\\nIn addition to notifying Security Teams, we should also contact other Ancillary Teams that could monitor or provide assistance during a crisis. <strong>Use appropriate wording. For example instead of \\\"denial of service\\\" you might use \\\"server performance issues\\\" when contacting teams outside of Security.</strong>\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nBelow are distribution lists to reach Field Support managers and team leads for informational emails. These teams should be notified when a crisis is occurring. \\r\\n\\r\\n| Distribution List |\\r\\n| - | - | - | - |\\r\\n| Field Support managers | Email | Teams | Phone |\\r\\n|   |   |   |   |   |\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow are manager line numbers for emergency contacts to engage these teams during a crisis. \\r\\n\\r\\n| Emergency Contacts|\\r\\n| - | - | - |\\t\\r\\n| Team | Description/Actions | Manager's Line |\\r\\n| Command Center | Initial Crisis Response Point, Information Coordination |   |\\t  \\r\\n| Server Team |\\tAnalyze and take offline servers |   |\\t  \\r\\n| Network Team | Bring down networked devices |   |\\t  \\r\\n| Applications Team | Application administration |   |\\t  \\r\\n| Field Support (reached via Command Center) | Remote on-site support |   |   |\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 3 - Information Coordination \\r\\nCollect additional analytical information about the crisis and coordinate in a manner in which each team receives the same information. It is the Senior Analyst's responsibility to coordinate each team's efforts (if a Senior Analyst/Manager is not available, the task falls to a SOC Analyst that is not on console). This can be done by using one or more of the following communication methods: Conference Call, Phone Bridge, or SOC War Room. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n<strong>Conference Call</strong> - If the number of technicians working on the crisis is low (less than 5 people) a conference call can be initiated to coordinate efforts. Note: This is usually only used in the latter stages of crisis resolution when specific technical personnel have been identified to solve the problem. See how to initiate a conference call: Telephone Functions \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n<strong>Phone Bridge</strong> - Phone Bridges are the standard way of communicating across multiple teams and should be used when more than 5 technicians are on the call. See how to initiate a phone bridge: Phone Bridge Information \\r\\n\\r\\nPhone bridges will typically include: \\r\\n- SOC Management \\r\\n- SOC Support (as needed) \\r\\n\\t- Incident Response Team \\r\\n\\t- Data Center Operator \\r\\n\\t\\t- Event Manager \\r\\n\\t\\t- Fix Analyst \\r\\n\\t\\t- Fix Manager \\r\\n\\t- Ancillary Teams (as needed) \\r\\n\\t\\t- Server Team \\r\\n\\t\\t- Network Team \\r\\n\\t\\t- Applications Team \\r\\n\\t\\t- Etc. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tNOTE: Teams will identify their Fix Managers, Fix Analysts, and other key players as the Crisis Response requires. \\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>SOC War Room</strong>  - The SOC will likely be the area where multiple teams meet for face-to-face communication. The SOC War Room will be the CCC Conference Room. A Crisis Response situation will supersede any reservations other teams may have for the CCC Conference Room. A Word Document page or a SharePoint OneNote should be created and displayed in the SOC War Room to serve as a whiteboard to capture and manage current response actions. \\r\\n\\r\\n##Step 4 - Information Management \\r\\nThe SOC will provide hourly updates on the crisis to the involved teams as well as Upper Management. A Senior SOC Analyst will provide hourly e-mails and be responsible for keeping each team updated and in sync. Each update should include a timeline of events and current actions taking place by teams. An example is below. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\nThe SOC will generate a final email detailing the events involved in the crisis, steps that were taken to resolve the crisis and further actions that may be necessary to return to status quo once the crisis is deemed over. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 5 - Crisis Remediation \\r\\nThe final step involves identifying a solution to the crisis and implementing the solution. This step should be carried out by the team that owns the device(s) that will contribute in mitigating the crisis. The SOC can be used to contact internal [CUSTOMER]'s Systems teams and external parties if necessary. Detailed information of a contact to any internal or external person should be documented in the knowledge base including the name, contact information and action of the party. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\nThe SOC should assist in further monitoring of the crisis and coordinating among teams until the resolution is implemented. Long-term incidents involving several teams will require team-member rotation. The SOC will work on a rotating schedule until the crisis is resolved. SOC Analysts will continue to work as scheduled. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Email Example\\r\\n\\r\\n![Email Example](https://github.com/rinure-msft/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/docs/EmailExample.png?raw=true)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Process Owner\\r\\nSOC Manager\\r\\n\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Crisis Response\"},\"name\":\"Crisis Response Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# Shift Log Management\\r\\n\\r\\n## Description \\r\\nThis procedure describes how a SOC Analyst should use Shift Logs and what information should be provided in a shift log entry. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Shift Log Entries \\r\\nIt is very important for shift log entries to be clear and concise while providing the necessary information. When selecting the appropriate information to enter, an analyst should consider how shift log information is used. We primarily use shift log entries for two purposes: daily operational meetings, historical analysis and event reconstruction. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following information should be entered in a shift log entry: \\r\\n- Source IP/hostname and Port (or just multiple if > 5) \\r\\n- Destination IP/hostname and Port (or just multiple if > 5) \\r\\n- External vs. Internal \\r\\n- Base Event name \\r\\n- Permit vs. Blocked \\r\\n- Number of related Incidents/Alerts/events \\r\\n- Basic reasoning behind creating case or closing events \\r\\n\\t\\r\\nUsing the example below, your entry should include roughly the same type of information in the same order. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Creating Shift Logs \\r\\n<strong>Step 1 - Insert New Template Page</strong> \\r\\n\\r\\nLocate the OneNote Section for the current month and select that Section. Select the Shift Log Template and copy the contents to the new Month/Day Shift page. This page provides the template for the daily shift log pages. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\nThe template page will be located on the Shift Logs section for the selected month. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n<strong>Step 2 - Enter Date and Analyst Name</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this example, on the monthly Example Shift Log OneNote Section for the current month we will add the date and Analyst Name to a new page. Each Analyst will have their own page as shown below.\\r\\n\\r\\n![OneNote Analyst Page](https://github.com/rinure-msft/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/docs/OneNoteAnalystPage.png?raw=true)\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Step 3 - Make Changes as Needed</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nMake the necessary changes to the date and time fields as well as any other links that should be changed.

There are other times when a particular domain name is considered especially malicious and the SOC wants to be notified when someone attempts to or successfully connects to one of these domains. To facilitate this we have created several Blacklists which can be modified by the analyst as new information comes available.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a malicious IP or domain is identified and added to a blacklist, a search for any previous connection attempts within the past 24 hours must be run in as a KQL query within Microsoft Sentinel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft Sentinel watchlists enable the collection of data from external data sources for correlation with the events in your Microsoft Sentinel environment. Once created, you can use watchlists in your search, detection rules, threat hunting, and response playbooks. Watchlists are stored in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace as name-value pairs and are cached for optimal query performance and low latency.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Common scenarios for using watchlists include:</strong>\\r\\n- Investigating threats and responding to incidents quickly with the rapid import of IP addresses, file hashes, and other data from CSV files. Once imported, you can use watchlist name-value pairs for joins and filters in alert rules, threat hunting, workbooks, notebooks, and general queries.\\r\\n- Importing business data as a watchlist.

The responsiveness of a security analyst towards the triggered incidents (also known as Mean Time To Acknowledge - MTTA) is crucial as being able to respond to a security incident quickly and efficiently will reduce the incident impact and mitigate the security threats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newly introduced Automation Rules allow you to automatically assign incidents to an owner with the built-in action. This is extremely useful when you need to assign specific incidents to a dedicated SME. It will reduce the time of acknowledgement and ensure accountability for each incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome organizations have a group of analysts working different shift schedules and required the ability to assign an incident to an analyst automatically based on the working schedule to improve the MTTA. The information found on this page will help SOC's automate their incident management process and improve their MTTA.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Considerations and Design Decisions\\r\\n\\r\\n**Scheduling tool**\\r\\n- Shifts for Teams is used as the scheduling tool because it is available as part of the Microsoft Teams and it provides the ability to create and manage employee schedules.\\r\\n- It is easier to automate incident assignment when there is a centralized schedule management tool to keep track of employees’ timesheet or availability.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Assignment criteria**\\r\\n- The goal is to assign the incidents equally across all analysts. Hence, the analyst with the least number of incidents in current shift will be assigned first.\\r\\n- We also need to consider the average time a security analyst takes to resolve a security incident (also known as Mean Time To Resolve - MTTR). In this Playbook, I have set a default value of 1 hour as the MTTR (a configurable variable) and I am using it as a condition where a security analyst must have at least 1 hour remaining in the shift to be eligible for incident assignment. For example, if a security analyst is about to go off shift in 30 minutes, the incident won’t be assigned to that analyst as the remaining time is less than the default value of 1 hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Notification**\\r\\n- It is important to notify the assignee when an incident is being assigned.\\r\\n- In this Playbook, an email will be sent to the assignee and a comment will be added to the incident on the incident assignment.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Shifts for Teams\\r\\n\\r\\nShifts is a schedule management application in Microsoft Teams that helps you create, update, and manage schedules for your team.

Data retention at the workspace level can be configured from 30 to 730 days (2 years) for all workspaces unless they are using the legacy Free pricing tier. Retention for individual data types can be set as low as 4 days. Learn more about pricing for longer data retention. To retain data longer than 730 days, consider using Log Analytics workspace data export @ https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Workspace level default retention\\r\\n1. In the Azure portal, from your workspace, select Usage and estimated costs from the left pane.\\r\\n2. On the Usage and estimated costs page, click Data Retention from the top of the page.\\r\\n3. On the pane, move the slider to increase or decrease the number of days and then click OK. If you are on the free tier, you will not be able to modify the data retention period and you need to upgrade to the paid tier in order to control this setting.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Change Retention](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/media/manage-cost-storage/manage-cost-change-retention-01.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the retention is lowered, there is a several day grace period before the data older than the new retention setting is removed. The Data Retention page allows retention settings of 30, 31, 60, 90, 120, 180, 270, 365, 550 and 730 days. If another setting is required, that can be configured using Azure Resource Manager using the retentionInDays parameter. When you set the data retention to 30 days, you can trigger an immediate purge of older data using the immediatePurgeDataOn30Days parameter (eliminating the several day grace period). \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE: This may be useful for compliance-related scenarios where immediate data removal is imperative. This immediate purge functionality is only exposed via Azure Resource Manager.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorkspaces with 30 days retention may actually retain data for 31 days.

From the Microsoft Sentinel navigation menu, select Analytics.\\r\\n2. In the action bar at the top, select +Create and select Scheduled query rule. This opens the Analytics rule wizard.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Detect Threats](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/media/tutorial-detect-threats-custom/create-scheduled-query-full.png#lightbox)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analytics rule wizard - General tab\\r\\n1. Provide a unique Name and a Description.\\r\\n2. In the Tactics field, you can choose from among categories of attacks by which to classify the rule. These are based on the tactics of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.\\r\\n3. Set the alert Severity as appropriate.\\r\\n4. When you create the rule, its Status is Enabled by default, which means it will run immediately after you finish creating it. If you don’t want it to run immediately, select Disabled, and the rule will be added to your Active rules tab and you can enable it from there when you need it.\\r\\n\\r\\n![General Tab](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/media/tutorial-detect-threats-custom/general-tab.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Define the rule query logic and configure settings\\r\\n- In the Set rule logic tab, you can either write a query directly in the Rule query field, or create the query in Log Analytics and then copy and paste it here.\\r\\n- Queries are written in Kusto Query Language (KQL). Learn more about KQL concepts and queries, and see this handy quick reference guide.\\r\\n- The example shown in this screenshot queries the SecurityEvent table to display a type of failed Windows logon events.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Set Rule Logic](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/media/tutorial-detect-threats-custom/set-rule-logic-tab-all-1-new.png#lightbox)\\r\\n\\r\\n- Here's another sample query, one that would alert you when an anomalous number of resources is created in Azure Activity.\\r\\n\\tAzureActivity\\r\\n\\t| where OperationName == \\\"Create or Update Virtual Machine\\\" or OperationName ==\\\"Create Deployment\\\"\\r\\n\\t| where ActivityStatus == \\\"Succeeded\\\"\\r\\n\\t| make-series dcount(ResourceId)  default=0 on EventSubmissionTimestamp in range(ago(7d), now(), 1d) by Caller\\r\\n\\r\\n### Rule query best practices\\r\\n- The query length should be between 1 and 10,000 characters and cannot contain \\\"search *\\\" or “union *”.\\r\\n- Using ADX functions to create Azure Data Explorer queries inside the Log Analytics query window is not supported.\\r\\n- When using the bag_unpack function in a query, if you project the columns as fields using \\\"project field1\\\" and the column doesn't exist, the query will fail. To guard against this happening, you must project the column as follows:\\r\\n\\tproject field1 = column_ifexists(\\\"field1\\\",\\\"\\\")\\r\\n\\r\\n## Alert enrichment\\r\\n- Use the Entity mapping configuration section to map parameters from your query results to Microsoft Sentinel-recognized entities. Entities enrich the rules' output (alerts and incidents) with essential information that serves as the building blocks of any investigative processes and remedial actions that follow. They are also the criteria by which you can group alerts together into incidents in the Incident settings tab.\\r\\n\\r\\nLearn more about entities in [Microsoft Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/entities-in-azure-sentinel).\\r\\n\\r\\n[See Map data fields to entities in Microsoft Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/map-data-fields-to-entities) for complete entity mapping instructions, along with important information about backward compatibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Use the Custom details configuration section to extract event data items from your query and surface them in the alerts produced by this rule, giving you immediate event content visibility in your alerts and incidents.\\r\\n\\r\\nLearn more about surfacing custom details in alerts, and see the [complete instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/surface-custom-details-in-alerts).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Query scheduling and alert threshold\\r\\n\\r\\n- In the Query scheduling section, set the following parameters:\\r\\n\\r\\n![Set Rule Logic](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/media/tutorial-detect-threats-custom/set-rule-logic-tab-all-2-new.png#lightbox)\\r\\n\\r\\n- Set Run query every to control how often the query is run - as frequently as every 5 minutes or as infrequently as once every 14 days.\\r\\n- Set Lookup data from the last to determine the time period of the data covered by the query - for example, it can query the past 10 minutes of data, or the past 6 hours of data. The maximum is 14 days.\\r\\n- Use the Alert threshold section to define the sensitivity level of the rule. For example, set Generate alert when number of query results to Is greater than and enter the number 1000 if you want the rule to generate an alert only if the query returns more than 1000 results each time it runs. This is a required field, so if you don’t want to set a threshold – that is, if you want your alert to register every event – enter 0 in the number field.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Results simulation\\r\\nIn the Results simulation area, in the right side of the wizard, select Test with current data and Microsoft Sentinel will show you a graph of the results (log events) the query would have generated over the last 50 times it would have run, according to the currently defined schedule. If you modify the query, select Test with current data again to update the graph. The graph shows the number of results over the defined time period, which is determined by the settings in the Query scheduling section.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere's what the results simulation might look like for the query in the screenshot above. The left side is the default view, and the right side is what you see when you hover over a point in time on the graph.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Results Simulation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/media/tutorial-detect-threats-custom/results-simulation.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you see that your query would trigger too many or too frequent alerts, you can experiment with the settings in the Query scheduling and Alert threshold sections and select Test with current data again.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Event grouping and rule suppression\\r\\n\\r\\n- Under Event grouping, choose one of two ways to handle the grouping of events into alerts:\\r\\n\\t- Group all events into a single alert (the default setting). The rule generates a single alert every time it runs, as long as the query returns more results than the specified alert threshold above. The alert includes a summary of all the events returned in the results.\\r\\n\\t- Trigger an alert for each event. The rule generates a unique alert for each event returned by the query. This is useful if you want events to be displayed individually, or if you want to group them by certain parameters - by user, hostname, or something else. You can define these parameters in the query.\\r\\n\\t- Currently the number of alerts a rule can generate is capped at 20. If in a particular rule, Event grouping is set to Trigger an alert for each event, and the rule's query returns more than 20 events, each of the first 19 events will generate a unique alert, and the 20th alert will summarize the entire set of returned events. In other words, the 20th alert is what would have been generated under the Group all events into a single alert option.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### What's the difference between events and alerts?\\r\\n\\tAn event is a description of a single occurrence of an action. For example, a single entry in a log file could count as an event. In this context an event refers to a single result returned by a query in an analytics rule.\\r\\n\\tAn alert is a collection of events that, taken together, are significant from a security standpoint. An alert could contain a single event if the event had significant security implications - an administrative login from a foreign country outside of office hours, for example.\\r\\n\\tBy the way, what are incidents? Microsoft Sentinel's internal logic creates incidents from alerts or groups of alerts. The incidents queue is the focal point of SOC analysts' work - triage, investigation and remediation.\\r\\n\\tMicrosoft Sentinel ingests raw events from some data sources, and already-processed alerts from others. It is important to note which one you're dealing with at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\n- In the Suppression section, you can turn the Stop running query after alert is generated setting On if, once you get an alert, you want to suspend the operation of this rule for a period of time exceeding the query interval. If you turn this on, you must set Stop running query for to the amount of time the query should stop running, up to 24 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Configure the incident creation settings\\r\\nIn the Incident Settings tab, you can choose whether and how Microsoft Sentinel turns alerts into actionable incidents. If this tab is left alone, Microsoft Sentinel will create a single, separate incident from each and every alert. You can choose to have no incidents created, or to group several alerts into a single incident, by changing the settings in this tab.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Incident Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/media/tutorial-detect-threats-custom/incident-settings-tab.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Incident settings\\r\\nIn the Incident settings section, Create incidents from alerts triggered by this analytics rule is set by default to Enabled, meaning that Microsoft Sentinel will create a single, separate incident from each and every alert triggered by the rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you don’t want this rule to result in the creation of any incidents (for example, if this rule is just to collect information for subsequent analysis), set this to Disabled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want a single incident to be created from a group of alerts, instead of one for every single alert, see the next section.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Alert grouping\\r\\nIn the Alert grouping section, if you want a single incident to be generated from a group of up to 150 similar or recurring alerts (see note), set Group related alerts, triggered by this analytics rule, into incidents to Enabled, and set the following parameters.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Limit the group to alerts created within the selected time frame: Determine the time frame within which the similar or recurring alerts will be grouped together. All of the corresponding alerts within this time frame will collectively generate an incident or a set of incidents (depending on the grouping settings below). Alerts outside this time frame will generate a separate incident or set of incidents.\\r\\n- Group alerts triggered by this analytics rule into a single incident by: Choose the basis on which alerts will be grouped together:\\r\\n\\t- Group alerts into a single incident if all the entities match: Alerts are grouped together if they share identical values for each of the mapped entities (defined in the Set rule logic tab above). This is the recommended setting.\\r\\n\\t- Group all alerts triggered by this rule into a single incident: All the alerts generated by this rule are grouped together even if they share no identical values.\\r\\n\\t- Group alerts into a single incident if the selected entities match: Alerts are grouped together if they share identical values for some of the mapped entities (that you can select from the drop-down list). You might want to use this setting if, for example, you want to create separate incidents based on the source or target IP addresses.\\r\\n- Re-open closed matching incidents: If an incident has been resolved and closed, and later on another alert is generated that should belong to that incident, set this setting to Enabled if you want the closed incident re-opened, and leave as Disabled if you want the alert to create a new incident.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Set automated responses and create the rule\\r\\n1. In the Automated responses tab, select any playbooks you want to run automatically when an alert is generated by the custom rule. For more information on creating and automating playbooks, see [Respond to threats](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-respond-threats-playbook).\\r\\n\\r\\n![Automated Response](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/media/tutorial-detect-threats-custom/automated-response-tab.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Select Review and create to review all the settings for your new alert rule. When the \\\"Validation passed\\\" message appears, select Create to initialize your alert rule.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Review and Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/media/tutorial-detect-threats-custom/review-and-create-tab.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## View the rule and its output\\r\\n- You can find your newly created custom rule (of type \\\"Scheduled\\\") in the table under the Active rules tab on the main Analytics screen. From this list you can enable, disable, or delete each rule.\\r\\n- To view the results of the alert rules you create, go to the Incidents page, where you can triage, investigate incidents, and remediate the threats.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Troubleshooting\\r\\nSee the following Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-custom#troubleshooting\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE: SOC managers should be sure to check the rule list regularly for the presence of auto-disabled rules.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Process Owner\\r\\nSOC Manager\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Content Development Design\"},\"name\":\"Content Development Design Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# Azure Infrastructure Monitoring\\r\\n\\r\\n## Configuration and change management\\r\\nAzure reviews and updates configuration settings and baseline configurations of hardware, software, and network devices annually.

A service team review is part of the testing that occurs before the deployment of their production service.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Vulnerability management\\r\\nSecurity update management helps protect systems from known vulnerabilities. Azure uses integrated deployment systems to manage the distribution and installation of security updates for Microsoft software. Azure is also able to draw on the resources of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). The MSRC identifies, monitors, responds to, and resolves security incidents and cloud vulnerabilities around the clock, every day of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Vulnerability scanning\\r\\nVulnerability scanning is performed on server operating systems, databases, and network devices. The vulnerability scans are performed on a quarterly basis at minimum. Azure contracts with independent assessors to perform penetration testing of the Azure boundary.

It will also cover how the engineering team will manage their Incidents and workload.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Workflow \\r\\nAt a high level, the engineering incident management process works like this: \\r\\n1. An Incident is opened in Microsoft Sentinel and the SOC Analyst tags the Incident with SOC-Engineering to assign the Incident to the SOC Engineering team. \\r\\n2. The engineers review the Incidents, assign an owner and prioritize \\r\\n3. The owner works through the issues until resolution \\r\\n4. Incident is closed \\r\\n\\r\\n## Detailed Steps \\r\\n<strong>Opening an Incident</strong> \\r\\n1. Within the Microsoft Sentinel, navigate to the Incidents Blade and search for tagged Incidents with \\\"SOC-Engineering\\\". These should be Incidents that require a SOC Engineer to look into for refinement.\\r\\n2. In the Comments, provide as much description as possible \\r\\n3. Validate the specific events that show the problem through a KQL query and attach the events to the incident by using a Bookmark. \\r\\n4. Notify the SOC Engineering team via Teams, Email or some other method.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Incident Review</strong> \\r\\n1. An Engineer will review each Incident to see if it is valid, if not the SOC Analyst who submitted the Incident to the SOC Engineering team will be notified with a detailed explanation. \\r\\n2. If the Incident is valid, an owner from the SOC Engineering team is assigned and the Incident is prioritized. \\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Resolution</strong> \\r\\n1. The Incident owner is responsible for providing updates as they become available. At a minimum, the Incident should be updated weekly unless the SOC Engineer assigned updates the tag to Stage = 'On Hold'. \\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Incident Closure</strong> \\r\\n1. When the problem is resolved, the Incident can be closed. This is done by assigning a tag - Stage = Closed and changes the Status of the Incident to Closed along with setting the Classification to one of the following depending on the Engineering Reason:\\r\\n\\t- False Positive - incorrect alert logic\\r\\n\\t- False Positive - incorrect data \\r\\n2. If required, this Workbook should be updated. ie: flows, connector tracking, installation instructions, etc... \\r\\n3. If appropriate, the SOC should be notified with any changes and instructions. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Process owner\\r\\nSOC Manager\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"Engineering Incident Management\"},\"name\":\"Engineering Incident Management Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# User Access Control Design\\r\\n\\r\\n## Permissions in Microsoft Sentinel\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft Sentinel uses Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to provide built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse Azure RBAC to create and assign roles within your security operations team to grant appropriate access to Microsoft Sentinel. The different roles give you fine-grained control over what users of Microsoft Sentinel can see and do. Azure roles can be assigned in the Microsoft Sentinel workspace directly (see note below), or in a subscription or resource group that the workspace belongs to, which Microsoft Sentinel will inherit.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Roles for working in Microsoft Sentinel\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Microsoft Sentinel-specific roles</strong>\\r\\nAll Microsoft Sentinel built-in roles grant read access to the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.\\r\\n- Microsoft Sentinel Reader can view data, incidents, workbooks, and other Microsoft Sentinel resources.\\r\\n- Microsoft Sentinel Responder can, in addition to the above, manage incidents (assign, dismiss, etc.)\\r\\n- Microsoft Sentinel Contributor can, in addition to the above, create and edit workbooks, analytics rules, and other Microsoft Sentinel resources.\\r\\n- Microsoft Sentinel Automation Contributor allows Microsoft Sentinel to add playbooks to automation rules. It is not meant for user accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tNOTE:\\r\\n\\tFor best results, these roles should be assigned on the resource group that contains the Microsoft Sentinel workspace. This way, the roles will apply to all the resources that are deployed to support Microsoft Sentinel, as those resources should also be placed in that same resource group.\\r\\n\\tAnother option is to assign the roles directly on the Microsoft Sentinel workspace itself. If you do this, you must also assign the same roles on the SecurityInsights solution resource in that workspace. You may need to assign them on other resources as well, and you will need to be constantly managing role assignments on resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Additional roles and permissions to consider\\r\\nUsers with particular job requirements may need to be assigned additional roles or specific permissions in order to accomplish their tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n- <strong>Working with playbooks to automate responses to threats</strong>\\r\\nMicrosoft Sentinel uses playbooks for automated threat response. Playbooks are built on Azure Logic Apps, and are a separate Azure resource. You might want to assign to specific members of your security operations team the ability to use Logic Apps for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) operations. You can use the Logic App Contributor role to assign explicit permission for using playbooks.\\r\\n- <strong>Connecting data sources to Microsoft Sentinel</strong>\\r\\nFor a user to add data connectors, you must assign the user write permissions on the Microsoft Sentinel workspace. Also, note the required additional permissions for each connector, as listed on the relevant connector page.\\r\\n- <strong>Guest users assigning incidents</strong>\\r\\nIf a guest user needs to be able to assign incidents, then in addition to the Microsoft Sentinel Responder role, the user will also need to be assigned the role of Directory Reader. Note that this role is not an Azure role but an Azure Active Directory role, and that regular (non-guest) users have this role assigned by default.\\r\\n- <strong>Creating and deleting workbooks</strong>\\r\\nFor a user to create and delete an Microsoft Sentinel workbook, the user will also need to be assigned with the Azure Monitor role of Monitoring Contributor. This role is not necessary for using workbooks, but only for creating and deleting.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Other roles you might see assigned\\r\\n\\r\\nIn assigning Microsoft Sentinel-specific Azure roles, you may come across other Azure and Log Analytics Azure roles that may have been assigned to users for other purposes. You should be aware that these roles grant a wider set of permissions that includes access to your Microsoft Sentinel workspace and other resources:\\r\\n\\r\\nAzure roles: Owner, Contributor, and Reader. Azure roles grant access across all your Azure resources, including Log Analytics workspaces and Microsoft Sentinel resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nLog Analytics roles: Log Analytics Contributor and Log Analytics Reader. Log Analytics roles grant access to your Log Analytics workspaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, a user who is assigned the Microsoft Sentinel Reader role, but not the Microsoft Sentinel Contributor role, will still be able to edit items in Microsoft Sentinel if assigned the Azure-level Contributor role. Therefore, if you want to grant permissions to a user only in Microsoft Sentinel, you should carefully remove this user’s prior permissions, making sure you do not break any needed access to another resource.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Microsoft Sentinel roles and allowed actions\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table summarizes the Microsoft Sentinel roles and their allowed actions in Microsoft Sentinel.\\r\\n\\r\\n| Role | Create and run playbooks | Create and edit analytic rules and other Microsoft Sentinel resources *\\t| Manage incidents (dismiss, assign, etc.) | View data, incidents, workbooks, and other Microsoft Sentinel resources |\\r\\n| - | - | - | - | - |\\r\\n| Microsoft Sentinel Reader | -- | -- | -- | ✓ |\\r\\n| Microsoft Sentinel Responder | -- | -- | ✓ | ✓ |\\r\\n| Microsoft Sentinel Contributor | -- | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\\r\\n| Microsoft Sentinel Contributor + Logic App Contributor | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\\r\\n\\r\\n* Creating and deleting workbooks requires the additional Monitoring Contributor role.

In addition to, or instead of, using Azure built-in roles, you can create Azure custom roles for Microsoft Sentinel. Azure custom roles for Microsoft Sentinel are created the same way you create other Azure custom roles, based on specific permissions to Microsoft Sentinel and to Azure Log Analytics resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nLog Analytics RBAC.

adaptive organization that embraces threat defense strategy of moving security processes earlier in the deployment process so that security is built in. This means that the traditional assignment of isolated technologies and processes to single security analysts no longer supports the vast increase in data coming in from multiple sources. Security analysts and engineers are being asked to take a more holistic approach and to use shared insights across different platforms and disciplines to take effective action.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this reason, the deployment and implementation of Microsoft’s Defender platform will need careful planning with the SOC team to optimize the day-to-day operations and lifecycle management of the Defender service itself. This content explores several concepts on how to operationalize and integrate Microsoft 365 Defender with either new or existing people, processes, and technologies that form the basis for modern security operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are not already familiar with Microsoft 365 Defender, see these articles:\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n- [Get started with Microsoft 365 Defender](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender/get-started?view=o365-worldwide)\\r\\n- [Turn on Microsoft 365 Defender](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender/m365d-enable?view=o365-worldwide)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your organization has already implemented some aspects of Microsoft 365 Defender, these articles can either affirm or help improve your existing architecture and processes. To integrate the capabilities of Microsoft 365 Defender, you will need to refine your SOC Processes, Procedures, and Services.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Target audience\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content is designed for the following:\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n- DevOps and Security Operations (SecOps) teams\\r\\n- Security engineering teams\\r\\n- IT teams\\r\\n- CISOs and CTOs\\r\\n- Red, Blue, and Purple Teams\\r\\n- CSIRT & forensic teams\\r\\n- Microsoft 365 administrators\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"SOC Integration for M365 Defender\"},\"name\":\"SOC Integration for M365 Defender Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# Plan for Microsoft 365 Defender operations readiness\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever the current maturity of your security operations, it is important for you to align with your Security Operations Center (SOC). While there is no single model that fits every organization, there are certain aspects that are more common than others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following sections below highlight some of the core functions of the SOC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Provide situational awareness of modern threats\\r\\n\\r\\nA SOC team prepares for and hunts new and incoming threats so that they can work with the organization to establish countermeasures and responses. Your SOC team should have personnel that are highly trained in modern attack methods and techniques and understand threat actors. Shared threat intelligence and frameworks like the Cyber Kill Chain or MITRE ATT&CK framework can empower your staff of threat analysts and threat hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Provide first, second, and potentially third level responses to cyber incidents and events\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SOC is the frontline of defense to security events and incidents. When an event, threat, attack, policy violation, or audit finding triggers an alert or call to action, the SOC team makes an assessment to triage and contain it or escalate it for investigation. Therefore, the SOC first line responders must have broad technical knowledge of security events and indicators.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Centralize monitoring and logging of your organization’s security sources\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually, the SOC team’s core function is to make sure all security devices such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, data loss prevention systems, threat and vulnerability management systems, and identity systems are functioning correctly and being monitored. The SOC teams will work with the broader network operations such as identity, DevOps, cloud, application, data science, and other business teams to ensure the analysis of security information is centralized and secured. Additionally, the SOC team is responsible for maintaining logs of the data in useable and readable formats, which could include parsing and normalizing disparate formats.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Establish Red, Blue, and Purple team operational readiness\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery SOC team should test its preparedness in responding to a cyber incident. Testing can be done via training exercises, such as table-tops and practice runs with various individuals in IT, security, and at the business level. Individual training exercise teams are created based on representative roles and are either playing the role of a defender (Blue Team), an attacker (Red Team), or as observers seeking to improve methods and techniques of both the Blue and Red teams through strengths and weakness that is uncovered during the exercise (Purple Team).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important that you purposefully define or refine the Processes and Procedures within this workbook prior to integrating with your M365 Defender Security Suite. Having clear definitions to your Processes and Procedures will ensure the best success to integrating with the M365 Defender Security Suite.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Next Step**\\r\\n\\r\\nSOC M365 Defender Readiness w/ Zero Trust\\r\\n\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"M365 Defender Planning\"},\"name\":\"M365 Defender Planning Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# Perform a SOC integration readiness assessment using the Zero Trust Framework\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the core functions of the Security Operations Center (SOC) team are defined, the next step for your organization is to prepare for the adoption of Microsoft Defender through a [Zero Trust approach](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/). Adoption can help you determine the requirements needed for deploying Microsoft 365 Defender using modern industry-leading practices, while evaluating Defender’s capabilities against your environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis approach is based on a strong foundation of protections and includes key areas such as identity, endpoints (devices), data, apps, infrastructure, and networking. The Readiness Assessment team will determine the areas where a foundational requirement for enabling Microsoft 365 Defender has not yet been met and will need remediation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are some of the items that will need to be remediated in order for the SOC to fully optimize processes in the SOC:\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n- Identity: Legacy on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domains, no MFA plan, no inventory of privileged accounts, and others.\\r\\n- Endpoints (devices): Large number of legacy operating systems, limited device inventory, and others.\\r\\n- Data and apps: Lack of data governance standards, no inventory of custom apps that won’t integrate.\\r\\n- Infrastructure: Large number of unsanctioned SaaS licenses, no container security, and others.\\r\\n- Networking: Performance issues due to low bandwidth, flat network, wireless security issues, and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, organizations need a new security model that effectively adapts to the complexity of the modern environment, embraces the mobile workforce, and protects people, devices, applications, and data wherever they are located. This is the core of Zero Trust. Instead of believing everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, the Zero Trust model teaches us to \\\"never trust, always verify.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[<img src=\\\"https://docs.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/media/diagram-zero-trust-security-elements.png\\\" width=\\\"700\\\"/>](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/media/diagram-zero-trust-security-elements.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can organize your approach to Zero Trust around these key technology pillars:\\r\\n\\r\\n| Zero Trust with M365 Defender |  |\\r\\n| - | - |\\r\\n| <br> ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/media/icon-identity-small.png) | **Secure identity with Zero Trust** <br> Identities—whether they represent people, services, or IoT devices—define the Zero Trust control plane. When an identity attempts to access a resource, verify that identity with strong authentication, and ensure access is compliant and typical for that identity. Follow least privilege access principles. |\\r\\n| <br> ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/media/icon-endpoints-small.png) |**Secure endpoints with Zero Trust** <br> Once an identity has been granted access to a resource, data can flow to a variety of different endpoints—from IoT devices to smartphones, BYOD to partner-managed devices, and on-premises workloads to cloud-hosted servers. This diversity creates a massive attack surface area. Monitor and enforce device health and compliance for secure access. |\\r\\n| <br> ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/media/icon-applications-small.png) |**Secure applications with Zero Trust** <br> Applications and APIs provide the interface by which data is consumed. They may be legacy on-premises, lifted-and-shifted to cloud workloads, or modern SaaS applications. Apply controls and technologies to discover shadow IT, ensure appropriate in-app permissions, gate access based on real-time analytics, monitor for abnormal behavior, control user actions, and validate secure configuration options. |\\r\\n| <br> ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/media/icon-data-small.png) |**Secure data with Zero Trust** <br> Ultimately, security teams are protecting data. Where possible, data should remain safe even if it leaves the devices, apps, infrastructure, and networks the organization controls. Classify, label, and encrypt data, and restrict access based on those attributes. |\\r\\n| <br> ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/media/icon-infrastructure-small.png) | **Secure infrastructure with Zero Trust** <br> Infrastructure—whether on-premises servers, cloud-based VMs, containers, or micro-services—represents a critical threat vector. Assess for version, configuration, and JIT access to harden defense. Use telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies, and automatically block and flag risky behavior and take protective actions. |\\r\\n| <br> ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/media/icon-networks-small.png) |**Secure networks with Zero Trust** <br> All data is ultimately accessed over network infrastructure. Networking controls can provide critical controls to enhance visibility and help prevent attackers from moving laterally across the network. Segment networks (and do deeper in-network micro-segmentation) and deploy real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics. |\\r\\n| <br> ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/media/icon-visibility-automation-orchestration-small.png) | **Visibility, automation, and orchestration with Zero Trust** <br> In our Zero Trust guides, we define the approach to implement an end-to-end Zero Trust methodology across identities, endpoints and devices, data, apps, infrastructure, and network. These activities increase your visibility, which gives you better data for making trust decisions. With each of these individual areas generating their own relevant alerts, we need an integrated capability to manage the resulting influx of data to better defend against threats and validate trust in a transaction. |\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganizations should also follow the [turning on Microsoft 365 Defender](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender/m365d-enable?view=o365-worldwide) article to capture the baseline set of configuration requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\n*NOTE: These steps will in turn determine remediation activities the SOC teams will have to carry out to effectively develop use cases.*\\r\\n\\r\\n## Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nWe recommend creating a Zero Trust solution that integrates with Microsoft products and services, and following Zero Trust best practices when developing applications.

SOC teams should work with those individuals to ensure proper oversight of Microsoft 365 Defender.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany modern SOCs assign its team members to categories based on their skillsets and functions.

Maintaining cyber hygiene across platforms can be challenging because of the vast amount of data coming from dozens if not hundreds of security sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity tools are interrelated. Turning on one feature in a security technology or changing a process may in turn break another. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that your SOC team formalize a method for defining and prioritizing use cases. Use cases help define requirements and test processes for SOC operations across various teams. It creates a methodology for capturing metrics to determine if the right roles and mix of tasks are aligned to the right team with the right skillsets.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Develop and formalize use case process\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SOC should define a high-level standard and process for developing use cases, which would be regulated by the SOC Oversight team. The SOC Oversight team should work with your business, IT, legal, HR, and other groups to prioritize use cases for the SOC that will eventually make their way into the SOC team’s runbooks and playbooks. Priority of use cases are based on objectives, such as compliance or privacy.\\r\\nSOC Oversight activities related to use case development include:\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n- Requirements\\r\\n- Staffing or training needs\\r\\n- Software licenses\\r\\n- Vendor contracting\\r\\n- Managing plan\\r\\n- Maintaining use case registry\\r\\n- Maintaining/updating templates\\r\\n\\r\\nTo facilitate the runbook and playbook creation processes, create a use case decision tree.

Here is an example process for an anti-phishing campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/media/integrate-microsoft-365-defender-secops/example-detailed-use-case-workflow-phishing.png?view=o365-worldwide)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Use case example 2: Threat and vulnerability scanning\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother scenario where a use case could be used is for threat and vulnerability scanning. In this example, the SOC requires that threats and vulnerabilities be remediated against assets via approved processes that include scanning of assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is an example high-level storyboard for the threat and vulnerability management of assets.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/media/integrate-microsoft-365-defender-secops/example-use-case-workflow-storyboard-tvm.png?view=o365-worldwide)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Invoke the use case workflow for example 2\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is an example process for threat and vulnerability scanning.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/media/integrate-microsoft-365-defender-secops/example-detailed-use-case-workflow-tvm.png?view=o365-worldwide)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analyze the use case output and lessons learned\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a use case has been approved and tested, gaps among your security teams should be identified, along with people, processes, and the Microsoft 365 Defender technologies involved. Microsoft 365 Defender technologies should be analyzed to determine if they are capable of achieving desired outcomes. These can be tracked via a checklist or a matrix.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, in the anti-phishing scenario example, the SOC teams could have made the discoveries in this table.\\r\\n\\r\\n| SOC team | Requirement | People to meet requirement | Process to meet requirement | Relevant technology | Gap identified | Use case change log | Exempt (Y/N) |\\r\\n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\\r\\n| Threat Intelligence and Analytics team | Data sources are properly feeding the threat intelligence engines. | Threat Intelligence Analyst/Engineer | Data feed requirements established, threat intelligence triggers from approved sources | Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Threat Intelligence team did not use automation script to link Microsoft 365 Defender API with threat intel engines | Add Microsoft 365 Defender as data sources to threat engines <br> Update use case run book | N |\\r\\n| Monitoring team | Data sources are properly feeding the monitoring dashboards | Tier 1,2 SOC Analyst–Monitoring & Alerts | Workflow for reporting Security & Compliance Center Secure Score | [Alerts in Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/alerts) <br><br> Secure Score monitoring | No mechanism for SOC analysts to report successful new phishing variant detection to improve Secure Score <br><br> [Reporting in Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/reports-and-insights-in-security-and-compliance) | Add a process for tracking Secure Score improvement to Reporting workflows | N |\\r\\n| Engineering and SecOps Team | Change control updates are made in the SOC team runbooks | Tier 2 SOC Engineer | Change Control notification procedure for SOC team runbooks | Approved changes to security devices | Changes to Microsoft 365 Defender connectivity to SOC security technology requires approval | Add Microsoft Cloud App Security, Defender for Identity, Defender for Endpoint, Security & Compliance Center to SOC runbooks | Y |\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the SOC teams could have made the discoveries outlined in the table below in regard to the threat and vulnerability management scenario outlined above:\\r\\n\\r\\n| SOC team | Requirement | People to meet requirement | Process to meet requirement | Relevant technology | Gap identified | Use case change log | Exempt (Y/N) |\\r\\n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\\r\\n| SOC Oversight | All assets connected to approved networks are identified and categorized | SOC Oversight, BU owners, application owners, IT asset owners, etc. | Centralized asset management system to discover and list asset category and attributes based on risk. | ServiceNow or other assets. <br><br> [Microsoft 365 Device Inventory](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/device-discovery) | Only 70% of assets have been discovered. Microsoft 365 Defender remediation tracking only effective for known assets | Mature asset lifecycle management services to ensure Microsoft 365 Defender has 100% coverage | N |\\r\\n| Engineering & SecOps Teams | High impact and critical vulnerabilities in assets are remediated according to policy | SecOps engineers, SOC analysts: Vulnerability & Compliance, Security Engineering | Defined process for categorizing High Risk and Critical Vulnerabilities | [Threat and Vulnerability Management Dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt) | Defender for Endpoint has identified high impact, high alert devices with no remediation plan or implementation of Microsoft recommended activity | Add a workflow for notifying asset owners when remediation activity is required within 30 days per policy; Implement a ticketing system to notify asset owners of remediation steps. | N |\\r\\n| Monitoring Teams | Threat and vulnerability status is reported via company intranet portal | Tier 2 SOC analyst | Auto-generated reports from Microsoft 365 Defender showing remediation progress of assets | [Alerts in Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/alerts) <br><br> Secure Score monitoring | No views or dashboard reports being communicated to asset owners regarding threat and vulnerability status of assets. | Create automation script to populate status of high risk and critical asset vulnerability remediation to the organization. | N |\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these example use cases, the testing revealed several gaps in the SOC team’s requirements that were established as baselines for the responsibilities of each team. The use case checklist can be as comprehensive as needed to ensure that the SOC team is prepared for the Microsoft 365 Defender integration with new or existing SOC requirements. Since this will be an iterative process, the use case development process and the use case output content will naturally serve to update and mature the SOC’s runbooks with lessons learned.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Update production runbooks and playbooks\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce use case testing has been remediated for all gaps, the lessons learned and metrics collected in them can be incorporated into your SOC team’s production runbooks (operating processes) and playbooks (incident responses and escalation procedures).\\r\\n\\r\\nMaintenance of the SOC team runbooks and playbooks can be organized in a multitude of ways. Each SOC team may be responsible for their own, or there may be a single centralized version for all teams to share in a central repository. Runbook and playbook management for individual organizations is based on size, skillsets, roles, and segregation of duties. Once a runbook has been updated, the playbook update process should follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse a standard IR framework for escalation\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaybooks are the steps the SOC teams will need to follow when a real event occurs, based on the successful integration and test of the use case. Therefore, it is imperative that the SOC follows a formalized approach to incident response, such as the [NIST Incident Response Standard](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) that has become one of the leading industry standards for incident response.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NIST four step incident response process includes four phases:\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n1. Preparation\\r\\n2. Detection and analysis\\r\\n3. Containment, eradication, and recovery\\r\\n4. Post-incident activity\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example: Tracking preparation phase activity**\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the core foundations of an escalation playbook is to ensure there is little ambiguity as to what each SOC team is supposed to do before, during, and after an event or incident. Therefore, it is good practice to list out step by step instructions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the Preparation phase could include an if/then or XoR matrix of tasks. In the case of the new phishing variant example use case, such a matrix could look like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n| Why is Escalation Warranted? | Next Step |\\r\\n| - | - |\\r\\n| Alert in SOC Monitoring rated as critical triggered > 500/hour | Go to Playbook A, Section 2, Activity 5 (with a link to the playbook section) |\\r\\n| eCommerce reported potential DDoS attack | Invoke Playbook B-Section C, Activity 19 (with a link to the playbook section) |\\r\\n| Executive reported a suspicious email as spear phishing attempt | Go to Playbook 5, Section 2, Activity 5 (with a link to the playbook section) |\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter executing the Preparation phase, organizations should invoke the remaining phases as outlined by NIST:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Detection and analysis\\r\\n- Containment, eradication, and recovery\\r\\n- Post-incident activity\\r\\n\\r\\n**Next Steps**\\r\\n\\r\\nSOC Defender Tasks\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"M365 Defender Develop & Test\"},\"name\":\"M365 Defender Develop & Test Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# Identify SOC maintenance tasks\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the periodic or as-needed tasks to maintain your SOC for Microsoft 365 Defender.\\r\\n\\r\\n| Activity | Description | Cadence | Team assigned |\\r\\n| - | - | - | - |\\r\\n| Service administration collaboration with SOC Teams | Administration of peripheral services such as asset tracking (CMDB), application licensing (new SaaS licenses), device purchases (upgrades or renew device deployments), and other Microsoft 365 tenant-wide changes (Intune, Microsoft 365, and others) that may affect deployment of Microsoft 365 Defender products. | Weekly and as needed | Engineering & SecOps |\\r\\n| Update anti-phishing and data loss prevention campaigns | Incorporate SOC use case and lessons learned with extended organization (HR, legal, training, and others). | Monthly and as needed | SOC Oversight | \\r\\n| Deploy automation scripts and services where appropriate | Download and test automation scripts and configuration files from approved Microsoft sites to improve Microsoft 365 Defender operations. | Weekly and as needed | Engineering and SecOps |\\r\\n| Portal or license management | Check announcements and the Microsoft Messaging Center for Microsoft 365 Defender portal or licensing needs based on Microsoft updates and new features. | Weekly | SOC Oversight |\\r\\n| Update SOC escalation tickets | All SOC teams update escalation tickets (such as Sentinel, ServiceNow tickets) assigned to them. | Daily | All SOC teams |\\r\\n| Track Microsoft 365 Defender Threat & Vulnerability remediation activity | Generate TvM Secure Score remediation activity and report to asset owners through an intranet portal. | Daily | Monitoring |\\r\\n| Generate Secure Score report | Monitoring team tracks and reports Secure Score improvements. | Weekly SOC | Monitoring |\\r\\n| Run IR tabletop exercise | Test SOC team playbooks in tabletop exercise. | As needed | All SOC teams |\\r\\n\\r\\nIntegrate these tasks into your current SOC processes.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Next steps**\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should review the guides referred to in this content and in the Microsoft 365 Defender library to determine how your own implementation of Microsoft 365 Defender should be structured and integrated.\\r\\n\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"M365 Defender SOC Tasks\"},\"name\":\"M365 Defender SOC Tasks Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# Incident response planning\\r\\n\\r\\nIncident response resources\\r\\n\\r\\n- Overview for Microsoft security products and resources for new-to-role and experienced analysts\\r\\n- Process for incident response process recommendations and best practices\\r\\n- Playbooks for detailed guidance on responding to common attack methods\\r\\n- Microsoft 365 Defender incident response\\r\\n- Microsoft Sentinel incident response\\r\\n\\r\\nUse this table as a checklist to prepare your Security Operations Center (SOC) to respond to cybersecurity incidents.\\r\\n\"},\"customWidth\":\"75\",\"conditionalVisibility\":{\"parameterName\":\"Tab\",\"comparison\":\"isEqualTo\",\"value\":\"M365 Defender IR Planning\"},\"name\":\"M365 Defender IR Planning Text\"},{\"type\":1,\"content\":{\"json\":\"# SOC Investigations\\r\\n\\r\\nYou need to respond quickly to detected security attacks to contain and remediate its damage.
