Adhere to your organization’s naming convention and ensure the name is globally unique since it is used (along with the uniqueString() function) to identify the ARM template being deployed.\n- Workspace ID: Found in the \"Overview\" tab for the Log Analytics Workspace of the Sentinel instance and provided for convenience on the connector information page.\n- Lumen API Key: Obtain an API key through Lumen support\n- Lumen Base URL: Filled in automatically and should generally not be changed. This URL contains API endpoints used by the connector\n- Tenant ID: Obtained from the Entra App Registration overview page for the registered application (listed as Directory ID) and can also be obtained from the Tenant Information page in Azure\n- Client ID: Obtained from the Entra App Registration overview page for the registered application (listed as Application ID)\n- Client Secret: Obtained when the secret is created during the app registration process. It can only be viewed when first created and is hidden permanently afterwards. Rerun the app registration process to obtain a new Client Secret if necessary.\n- App Insights Workspace Resource ID: Obtained from the overview page of the Log Analytics Workspace for your Sentinel instance. Click on the \"JSON View\" link in the top right and the Resource ID will be displayed at the top with a copy button.\n- Blob Container Name: Use the default name unless otherwise required.
