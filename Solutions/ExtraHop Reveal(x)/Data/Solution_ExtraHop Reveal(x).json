  "Description": "The [ExtraHop Reveal(x)](https://www.extrahop.com/products/security/) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables ingestion of Common Event Format (CEF) logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This solution enables you to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation. This integration gives you the ability to gain insight into your organization's network and improve your security operation capabilities.\n\r\n1. **ExtraHop Reveal(x) via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting ExtraHop Reveal(x) logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **ExtraHop Reveal(x) via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting ExtraHop Reveal(x) logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of ExtraHop Reveal(x) via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
