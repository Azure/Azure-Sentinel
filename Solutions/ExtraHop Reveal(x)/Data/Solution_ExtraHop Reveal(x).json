  "Description": "The [ExtraHop Reveal(x)](https://www.extrahop.com/products/security/) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables ingestion of Common Event Format (CEF) logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This solution enables you to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation. This integration gives you the ability to gain insight into your organization's network and improve your security operation capabilities.\n\n This solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors are about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024.**",
