  "Description": "The [SonicWall Firewall](https://www.sonicwall.com/products/firewalls/) solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables ingestion of events using the Common Event Format (CEF) into Microsoft Sentinel for [SonicWall Firewalls](https://www.sonicwall.com/support/technical-documentation/?q=CEF&language=English).\n\r\n This solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation. \n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors were deprecated on **Aug 31, 2024**.",
