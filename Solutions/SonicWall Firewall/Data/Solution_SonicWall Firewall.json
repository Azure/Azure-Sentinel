  "Description": "The [SonicWall Firewall](https://www.sonicwall.com/products/firewalls/) solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables ingestion of events using the Common Event Format (CEF) into Microsoft Sentinel for [SonicWall Firewalls](https://www.sonicwall.com/support/technical-documentation/?q=CEF&language=English).\n\r\n1. **SonicWall Firewall via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting SonicWall Firewall logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **SonicWall Firewall via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting SonicWall Firewall logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of SonicWall Firewall via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
