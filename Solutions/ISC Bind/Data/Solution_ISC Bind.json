  "Description": "The [ISC Bind](https://www.isc.org/bind/) solution for Microsoft Sentinel allows you to ingest ISC Bind logs to get better insights into your organization's network traffic data, DNS query data, traffic statistics and improves your security operation capabilities.\n\nThis solution is dependent on the Syslog solution containing the Syslog via AMA connector to collect the logs. The Syslog  solution will be installed as part of this solution installation. \n\n **NOTE**: Microsoft recommends installation of Syslog via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which were deprecated on **Aug 31, 2024.** Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
