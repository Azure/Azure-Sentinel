  "Description": "The [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_in/business.html) TippingPoint Microsoft Sentinel Solution allows you to easily connect your [TippingPoint](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network/intrusion-prevention/tipping-point-threat-protection-system.html) SMS IPS events with Microsoft Sentinel, to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation.\n\n This solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation. \n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which were deprecated on **Aug 31, 2024.** Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
