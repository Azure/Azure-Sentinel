name: Semperis DSP Well-known privileged SIDs in sIDHistory
description: |
  'This indicator looks for security principals that contain specific SIDs of accounts from built-in privileged groups within their sIDHistory attribute. This would allow those security principals to have the same privileges as those privileged accounts, but in a way that is not obvious to monitor (e.g. through group membership).'
