description: |
  'Mimikatz's DCShadow switch allows a user who has compromised an AD domain, to inject arbitrary changes into AD using a "fake" domain controller. These changes bypass the security event log and can't be spotted using normal AD tools. This rule looks for evidence that a machine has been used in this capacity.'
