  "Description": "The Cisco Meraki solution allows you to easily connect your Cisco Meraki (MX/MR/MS) logs with Microsoft Sentinel. This gives you more insight into your organization's network and improves your security operation capabilities.\n\n This solution is dependent on the Custom logs via AMA connector to collect the logs. The Custom logs solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n **NOTE**: Microsoft recommends installation of Custom logs via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which were deprecated on **Aug 31, 2024.** Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
