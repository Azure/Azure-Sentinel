It helps organizations identify compromised credentials linked to corporate domains, reducing the risk of account takeover and unauthorized access. Enriched account breach data is ingested into Sentinel, enabling security teams to correlate with internal activity, trigger alerts, and automate remediation actions such as password resets and access revocation.",
