name: SharePointFileOperation via previously unseen IPs
description: |
  'Shows SharePoint upload/download volume by IPs with high-risk ASNs. New IPs with volume spikes may be unauthorized and exfiltrating documents.'
description-detailed: |
  'Shows volume of documents uploaded to or downloaded from SharePoint by IPs with ASNs associated with high user lockout or malicious activity.
  In stable environments such connections by new IPs may be unauthorized, especially if associated with
  spikes in volume which could be associated with large-scale document exfiltration.'
