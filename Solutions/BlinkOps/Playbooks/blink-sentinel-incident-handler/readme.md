# Blink-Sentinel-Incident-Trigger

## Summary

This playbook automatically triggers when a **Microsoft Sentinel incident is created or updated**, and sends a structured HTTPS POST request to **Blink**. The integration enables seamless coordination between Sentinel Incident alerts and Blink automation workflows, allowing for rapid incident response, ticketing, notification dispatch, or any custom workflow configured in Blink.
