# Sentinel Alert Trigger

## Summary

This playbook automatically triggers when a **Microsoft Sentinel alert is created**, and sends a structured HTTPS POST request to **Blink**. The integration enables seamless coordination between Sentinel alerts and Blink automation workflows, allowing for rapid alert response, ticketing, notification dispatch, or any custom workflow configured in Blink.
