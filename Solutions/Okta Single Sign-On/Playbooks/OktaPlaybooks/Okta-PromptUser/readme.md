# Okta-Prompt User Playbook
 ## Summary

When a new Microsoft Sentinel incident is created, this playbook gets triggered and performs below actions:
1. An adaptive card is sent to the risky user asking if they have done the malicious activity
2. If user confirms yes, the incident will be closed  and enriched as a comment with the user details
3. Else, the **user sessions will be cleared** and **reset password link will be sent to user** 
4. An adaptive card is sent to the SOC Teams channel, providing information about the incident and risky user details. The SOC can investigate further on the user.

## Playbook steps explained
### When Microsoft Sentinel incident creation rule is triggered

Microsoft Sentinel incident is created. The playbook receives the incident as the input.
### Entities - Get Accounts

Get the list of risky/malicious accounts as entities from the Incident
### For each-risky account received from the incident
Iterates on the accounts found in this incident (probably one) and performs the following:
For the risky user account, playbook uses "Get User" action to get user details from Okta
#### Posts an Adaptive card to  user 
In this step we post a message in Microsoft Teams to the risky user with Incident details and ask for his confirmation on the malicious activity described in the incident.
#### If Condition based on the user confirmation
#### If the user confirms it was him:
  a. Incident is commented with all the  details below
   * User information collected by "Get User" action from Okta
     User id, User name, User login, User email, User status, User created, User activated, User statusChanged, User lastLogin, User lastUpdated, User passwordChanged
   * Actions taken on Sentinel 

  b. Close Incident
#### If the user confirms it was not him:
  a. Playbook uses "Clear User Sessions" action to clear the user sessions in Okta

  b. Playbook uses "Reset Password" action to resest the password of the user in Okta


  c. SOC user will be sent an adaptive card with the user details, Incident information to investigate further

  d. Add a comment to the incident with the following details:
  
  * User information collected by "Get User" action from Okta such as
     * User id, User name,User login,User email,User status,User created,User activated,User statusChanged, User lastLogin, User lastUpdated, User passwordChanged
