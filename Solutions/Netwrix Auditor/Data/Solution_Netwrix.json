	"Description": "The Netwrix Auditor solution provides the capability to ingest [ Netwrix Auditor](https://www.netwrix.com/auditor.html) (formerly Stealthbits Privileged Activity Manager) events into Microsoft Sentinel. Refer to Netwrix [documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/) for more information.\n\r\n1. **Netwrix Auditor via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting Netwrix Auditor logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **Netwrix Auditor via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting Netwrix Auditor logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of Netwrix Auditor via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
