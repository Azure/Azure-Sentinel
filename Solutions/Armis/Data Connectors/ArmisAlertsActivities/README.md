# ArmisAlertsActivities Integration for Microsoft Sentinel

## Introduction

This folder contains the Azure function time trigger code for ArmisAlertsActivities-Microsoft Sentinel connector. The connector will run periodically and ingest the Armis Alerts & Activities data into the Microsoft Sentinel logs custom table `Armis_Alerts_CL` and `Armis_Activities_CL`.
## Folders

1. `ArmisAlertsActivities/` - This contains the package, requirements, ARM JSON file, connector page template JSON, and other dependencies.
2. `ArmisAlertActivitySentinelConnector/` - This contains the Azure function source code along with sample data.


## Installing for the users

After the solution is published, we can find the connector in the connector gallery of Microsoft Sentinel among other connectors in Data connectors section of Sentinel.

i. Go to Microsoft Sentinel -> Data Connectors

ii. Click on the ArmisAlertsActivities connector, connector page will open.

iii. Click on the blue `Deploy to Azure` button.


It will lead to a custom deployment page where after user need to select **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and **Location**.
And need to enter below information to configure Armis Alerts data connector.
