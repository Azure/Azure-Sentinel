# Microsoft Exchange Security Sentinel Solution - Public Contents

**Exchange Servers** have recently been the target of many attacks. The cases and escalations opened recently have revealed poorly managed environments. Exchange Server security assessments regularly discover many insecured configurations putting the messaging system at risk of being compromised without much effort. However Exchange Servers are rarely monitored sufficiently from a security perspective and traces and logs often canâ€™t be collected on time when investigations need to be performed.

Introducing **M**icrosoft **E**xchange **S**ecurity Solution

We built two Sentinel solutions :

* **Microsoft Exchange Security for Exchange On-Premises**
* **Microsoft Exchange Security for Exchange Online**

Both solution collects and detects sensitive security operations happening on On-Premises Exchange Servers and Exchange Online using Microsoft Sentinel. This allows service owners and SOC teams to :

* Detect unsecure configurations
* Detect to attacks targeting Exchange Servers
* Alert on sensitive administrative operations
* Report on incorrect RBAC configurations putting the environment at risk

The solution also allows hunters to search a very diverse set of data to find abnormal behaviors.
