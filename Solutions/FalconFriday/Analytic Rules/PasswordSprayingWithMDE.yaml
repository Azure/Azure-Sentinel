name: Password Spraying
description: |
  This query detects a password spraying attack, where a single machine has performed a large number of failed login attempts, with a large number of different accounts. 
  For each account, the attacker uses just a few attempts to prevent account lockout. This query uses the DeviceLogonEvents per machine to detect a password spraying attacks. 
  The machine against which the password spraying is performed (can be DC, a server or even an endpoint) needs to be enrolled in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
