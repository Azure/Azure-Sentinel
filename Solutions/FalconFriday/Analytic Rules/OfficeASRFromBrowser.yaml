name: Office ASR rule triggered from browser spawned office process.  
description: |
  The attacker sends a spearphishing email to a user. The email contains a link which points to a website that eventually presents the user a download of an MS Office document. This document contains a malicious macro. The macro triggers one of the ASR rules. 
  This detection looks for Office ASR violations triggered by an Office document opened from a browser.
  Note: be aware that you need to have the proper ASR rules enabled for this detection to work.
