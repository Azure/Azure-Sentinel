name: Suspicious parentprocess relationship - Office child processes. 
description: |
  The attacker sends a spearphishing email to a user. The email contains a link, which points to a website that eventually presents the user a download of an MS Office document. This document contains a malicious macro. The macro spawns a new child process providing initial access. This detection looks for suspicious parent-process chains starting with a browser which spawns an Office application which spawns something else.
