  "Description": "The [**Pathlock App**](https://pathlock.com/) solution enables organizations to seamlessly ingest **Pathlock Threat Detection** events from both on-premise and cloud-based SAP systems into **Microsoft Sentinel**.\n\nThis integration leverages the **Custom Logs via Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** connector to collect and forward log data securely. The Custom Logs solution will be automatically deployed as part of this installation process.\n\n> **Note:** Microsoft recommends using **Custom Logs via the AMA connector**. The legacy **Log Analytics (MMA)** agent was deprecated on **August 31, 2024**. Running both MMA and AMA on the same host can lead to log duplication and increased ingestion costs.
