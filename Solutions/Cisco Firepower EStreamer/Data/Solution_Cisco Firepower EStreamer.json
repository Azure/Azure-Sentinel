  "Description": "The [Cisco Firepower](https://www.cisco.com/site/in/en/products/security/firewalls/index.html) eStreamer Solution for Microsoft Sentinel works with [Cisco Event Streamer](https://github.com/CiscoSecurity/fp-05-microsoft-sentinel-connector) (also known as eStreamer) and allows you to stream System intrusion, discovery and connection data from Firepower Management Center (FMC) or managed device to Microsoft Sentinel \r\n eStreamer is a Client Server API designed for the Cisco Firepower NGFW Solution. The eStreamer client requests detailed event data on behalf of the SIEM or logging solution in the Common Event Format (CEF).\n\n This solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n**NOTE: **Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors are about to be deprecated by Aug 31, 2024.",
