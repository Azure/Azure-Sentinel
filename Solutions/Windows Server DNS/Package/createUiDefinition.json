The DNS logs are collected only from Windows agents.\n\nInstalling this solution will deploy two data connectors,\n\r\n1. DNS via AMA - This data connector helps in ingesting Windows DNS logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-dns-ama). Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector.\r\n\n2. DNS via Legacy Agent - This data connector helps in ingesting Windows DNS logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\r\n<P style=\"color:red\">**NOTE**: Microsoft recommends Installation of DNS via AMA. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported.\n\n**Data Connectors:** 2, **Workbooks:** 1, **Analytic Rules:** 5, **Hunting Queries:** 9\n\n[Learn more about Microsoft Sentinel](https://aka.ms/azuresentinel) | [Learn more about Solutions](https://aka.ms/azuresentinelsolutionsdoc)",
