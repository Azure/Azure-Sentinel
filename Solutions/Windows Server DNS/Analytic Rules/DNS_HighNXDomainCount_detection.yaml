name: Potential DGA detected
description: |
  'Identifies clients with a high NXDomain count, which could be indicative of a DGA (cycling through possible C2 domains where most C2s are not live).
  Alerts are generated when a new IP address is seen (based on not being associated with
  NXDomain records in the prior 10-day baseline period).'
