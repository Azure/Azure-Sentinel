# Cohesity Create or Update ServiceNow Incident Playbook
## Summary
This playbook creates a ticket on ServiceNow's Now Platform. It can be also used for updating the ServiceNow ticket or closing it. For example, an automation rule can be created to close the ServiceNow ticket by running this playbook when the corresponding Sentinel ticket is closed.

## Prerequisites
1. Create an account on [ServiceNow's Now Platform](https://signon.service-now.com/x_snc_sso_auth.do).

## Deployment instructions
1. Click on the "Deploy to Azure" button to deploy the playbook. This step directs you to deploy an ARM Template wizard.
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FSolutions%2FCohesitySecurity%2FPlaybooks%2FCohesity_CreateOrUpdate_ServiceNow_Incident%2Fazuredeploy.json)
2. Fill in the required parameters:
* __Playbook Name:__ Enter the playbook name here.

## Post-Deployment instructions
1. Make sure the user that runs the playbook has the role _Microsoft Sentinel Playbook Operator_ assigned. To assign the role,
* Under the _Subscriptions_ tab from the _Home_ page, choose your subscription name.
* Choose the _Access Control (IAM)_ option from the left pane.
* Click on _Add > Add Role Assignment_ and add _Microsoft Sentinel Playbook Operator_ to the user.

2. Enter and authorize ServiceNow credentials in the playbook (read more about editing connections [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/understanding-api-connections-for-your-microsoft-sentinel/ba-p/2593973))
* Go to _Logic Apps_ and choose your app (playbook).
* Select _Development Tools\API Connections_.
* Select a connection you'd like to authorize.
* Click on General\Edit API Connection.
* Enter path to your ServiceNow instance, e.g. dev12345.service-now.com
* Enter username.
* Enter password.
* Click Save.

**Note:** You can get the credentials at your ServiceNow instance by going to _My account\Instance Action\Manage instance password_.

Alternatively, you can follow these steps to achieve the same goal. This would be especially useful if the previous steps didnâ€™t work for you.
* Go to _Logic Apps_.
* Click on the playbook and press _Edit_.
* Choose _ServiceNow_ block.
* Click on _Change Connection_.
* Click on the "!" icon to enter ServiceNow credentials or choose a different, previously authorized, connection with the correct credentials.
* Press _Save_ button to save changes in your playbook.
* If it doesn't work, repeat the steps but either choose a different connection or fix possible authorization errors, e.g. wrong user/password or incorrect path to the instance, for the chosen one.

3. For the playbook to run, there is a need to assign the Microsoft Sentinel Responder role to the playbook's managed identity.
* Under the _Subscriptions_ tab from the _Home_ page, choose your subscription name.
* Choose the _Access Control (IAM)_ option from the left pane.
* Click on _Add > Add Role Assignment_ and add _Microsoft Sentinel Responder_ managed identity role to the playbook.

4. (Recommendation) You can create an automation rule to close the corresponding ServiceNow ticket when the corresponding Sentinel ticket is closed.
* In _Microsoft Sentinel | Automation_ press _+Create\Automation Rule_.
* Enter an automation rule name of your choice.
* In _Trigger_ choose __When incident is updated__.
* Set the following conditions using _AND_ rule
  * _Analytic rule name_ contains **All**.
  * _Tag_ contains **SNOW System ID**.
  * _Status_ changed to **Closed**.
* In _Actions_ choose to run this playbook.
* Click _Apply_.
