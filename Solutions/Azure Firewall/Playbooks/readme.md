## Overview
Azure Firewall is a cloud-based network security service, sitting at the edge of the Azure virtual network resources, to provide additional security beyond what is offered by NSGs. <br>
This integration allows to automate response to Microsoft Sentinel incidents which contains IPs. It contains the basic connector component, with which you can create your own playbooks that interact with Azure Firewall, Azure Firewall Policy and IP Groups. <br>
It also contains 3 playbook templates, ready to quick use, that allow direct response on Azure Firewall from Microsoft Teams together and VirusTotal enrichment.

The playbooks in this integration work with:

| **Playbook Name**                  | **Premium Policy** | **Standard Policy** | **Classic Rules** |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| AzureFirewall-BlockIP-addToIPGroup | Yes                | Yes | Yes |
| AzureFirewall-AddIPtoTIAllowList   | No                 | Yes | No |
| AzureFirewall-BlockIP-addNewRule   | No                 | No | Yes |

# Firewall connector documentation 

<a name="authentication">

## Authentication
This connector supports Service Principal authentication type.
### Microsoft Entra ID Service principal
To use your own application with the Microsoft Sentinel connector, perform the following steps:

1. Register the application with Microsoft Entra ID and create a service principal. [Learn how](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal).

1. Get credentials (for future authentication).

    In the registered application blade, get the application credentials for later signing in:

    - Tenant Id: under **Overview**
    - Client ID: under **Overview**
    - Client secret: under **Certificates & secrets**.

1. Grant permissions to Azure Firewall, IP Groups or Azure Firewall Policies.

    - In the relevant resources of the above, go to Settings -> Access control (IAM)

    - Select **Add role assignment**.

    - Select the role you wish to assign to the application: **Contributor** role.

    - Find the required application and save. By default, Microsoft Entra ID applications aren't displayed in the available options. To find your application, search for the name and select it.

1. Authenticate

    In this step we use the app credentials to authenticate to the Sentinel connector in Logic Apps.

    In the custom connector for Azure Firewall, fill in the required parameters (can be found in the registered application blade)
        - Tenant Id: under **Overview**
        - Client Id: under **Overview**
        - Client Secret: under **Certificates & secrets**

<a name="prerequisites">

### Prerequisites for using and deploying Custom Connector
1. Register an Microsoft Entra ID app and capture the ClientID, SecretKey and TenantID
2. Playbook templates leverage VirusTotal for IP enrichment. To use this VirusTotal capabilities,generate a Virus Total API key. Refer this link [ how to generate the API Key](https://developers.virustotal.com/v3.0/reference#getting-started)
