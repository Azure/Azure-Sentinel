name: Abnormal Port to Protocol
description: |
  'Identifies communication for well known protocol over a non-standard port based on learning period activity. This can indicate malicious communication (C2) or exfiltration by attackers trying to communicate over known ports (22:SSH, 80:HTTP) but dont use the known protocol headers to match the port number.
  
  Configurable Parameters:
  
  - Learning period time - learning period for protocol learning in days. Default is set to 7.'
