  'Identifies abnormal ports used by machines to connect to a destination IP based on learning period activity. This can indicate exfiltration attack or C2 control from machines in the organization by using new a port that has never been used on the machine for communication.

  Configurable Parameters:

  - Learning period time - learning period for threshold calculation in days. Default is set to 7.'
