name: First Time Source IP to Destination Using Port
description: |
  'Identifies the first time a source IP communicates with a destination using a specific port based on learning period activity. This can indicate malicious communication (C2) from machines that never accessed the destination before, using a specific port. This query can also be used for hunting destinations that were never accessed before in the organization, and correlating it with different alerts for higher confidence.
  
  Configurable Parameters:
  
  - Learning period time - learning period for threshold calculation in days. Default is set to 7.'
