## Playbook steps explained

### When Microsoft Sentinel incident creation rule is triggered
Microsoft Sentinel incident is created. The playbook receives the incident as the input.

### Entities - Get Hosts
Get the list of risky devices as entities from the Incident

### Initialize variable to assign the Organization Id
Initialize an string variable to assign the Organization Id provided by Client while deploying the playbook and used a parameter while calling the search devices with organization API action.

### Initialize variable to assign the CarbonBlack devices information
Initialize an array variable to assign the CarbonBlack devices used as source to format the HTML with the devices information

### Initialize variable to assign the quarantined devices information
Initialize an array variable to assign the quarantined devices information used as source to format the HTML with the action takened devices information

### For each-Hosts
This action will perform the below actions
 a. Make a call to CarbonBlack API with the parameters such as Organization Key and Query [ Contains device name ]
 b. Verify the CarbonBlack returned the results and Check the device is quarantined
 c. If the device is not quarantined then isolate it.

### Construct HTML table - CarbonBlack devices information
This action will construct the HTML table with devices information

### Construct HTML table - Quarantined devices through playbook
This action will construct the HTML table with Quarantined devices through playbook

### Add a comment to the incident with the information
This action will enrich the incident with the constructed HTML table with devices information

### Close the comment
This action will close the incident if there is no exceptions occurred while quarantining the devices
