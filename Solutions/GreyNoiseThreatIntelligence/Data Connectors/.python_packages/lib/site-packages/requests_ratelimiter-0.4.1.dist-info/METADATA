This package is a simple wrapper around [pyrate-limiter](https://pyratelimiter.readthedocs.io)
that adds convenient integration with the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io) library.

Full project documentation can be found at [requests-ratelimiter.readthedocs.io](https://requests-ratelimiter.readthedocs.io).


# Features
* `pyrate-limiter` is a general-purpose rate limiting library that implements the leaky bucket
  algorithm, supports multiple rate limits, and has optional persistence with SQLite and Redis
  backends
* `requests-ratelimiter` adds some extra conveniences specific to sending HTTP requests with the
  `requests` library
* It can be used as either a
  [session](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects) or a
  [transport adapter](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#transport-adapters)
* It can also be used as a mixin, for compatibility with other `requests`-based libraries
* Rate limits are tracked separately per host
* Different rate limits can optionally be applied to different hosts

# Installation
```
pip install requests-ratelimiter
```

# Usage

## Usage Options
There are three ways to use `requests-ratelimiter`:

### Session
The simplest option is
[`LimiterSession`](https://requests-ratelimiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#requests_ratelimiter.LimiterSession),
which can be used as a drop-in replacement for
[`requests.Session`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Session).

Example:
```python
from requests_ratelimiter import LimiterSession
from time import time

# Apply a rate limit of 5 requests per second to all requests
session = LimiterSession(per_second=5)
start = time()

# Send requests that stay within the defined rate limit
for i in range(20):
    response = session.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
    print(f'[t+{time()-start:.2f}] Sent request {i+1}')
```

Example output:
```bash
[t+0.22] Sent request 1
[t+0.26] Sent request 2
[t+0.30] Sent request 3
[t+0.34] Sent request 4
[t+0.39] Sent request 5
[t+1.24] Sent request 6
[t+1.28] Sent request 7
[t+1.32] Sent request 8
[t+1.37] Sent request 9
[t+1.41] Sent request 10
[t+2.04] Sent request 11
...
```

### Adapter
For more advanced usage,
[`LimiterAdapter`](https://requests-ratelimiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#requests_ratelimiter.LimiterAdapter)
is available to be used as a
[transport adapter](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#transport-adapters).

Example:
```python
from requests import Session
from requests_ratelimiter import LimiterAdapter

session = Session()

# Apply a rate-limit (5 requests per second) to all requests
adapter = LimiterAdapter(per_second=5)
session.mount('http://', adapter)
session.mount('https://', adapter)

# Send rate-limited requests
for user_id in range(100):
    response = session.get(f'https://api.some_site.com/v1/users/{user_id}')
    print(response.json())
```

### Mixin
Finally,
[`LimiterMixin`](https://requests-ratelimiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#requests_ratelimiter.LimiterMixin)
is available for advanced use cases in which you want add rate-limiting features to a custom session
or adapter class. See
[Custom Session Example](#custom-session-example-requests-cache) below for an example.

## Rate Limit Settings
### Basic Settings
The following parameters are available for the most common rate limit intervals:
* `per_second`: Max requests per second
* `per_minute`: Max requests per minute
* `per_hour`: Max requests per hour
* `per_day`: Max requests per day
* `per_month`: Max requests per month
* `burst`: Max number of consecutive requests allowed before applying per-second rate-limiting

<!-- TODO: Section explaining burst rate limit -->

### Advanced Settings
If you need to define more complex rate limits, you can create a `Limiter` object instead:
```python
from pyrate_limiter import Duration, RequestRate, Limiter
from requests_ratelimiter import LimiterSession

nanocentury_rate = RequestRate(10, Duration.SECOND * 3.156)
fortnight_rate = RequestRate(1000, Duration.DAY * 14)
trimonthly_rate = RequestRate(10000, Duration.MONTH * 3)
limiter = Limiter(nanocentury_rate, fortnight_rate, trimonthly_rate)

session = LimiterSession(limiter=limiter)
```

See [pyrate-limiter docs](https://pyratelimiter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#basic-usage) for more `Limiter` usage details.

## Backends
By default, rate limits are tracked in memory and are not persistent. You can optionally use either
SQLite or Redis to persist rate limits across threads, processes, and/or application restarts.
You can specify which backend to use with the `bucket_class` argument. For example, to use SQLite:
```python
from pyrate_limiter import SQLiteBucket
from requests_ratelimiter import LimiterSession

session = LimiterSession(per_second=5, bucket_class=SQLiteBucket)
```

See [pyrate-limiter docs](https://pyratelimiter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#backends) for more details.

## Other Features
### Per-Host Rate Limit Tracking
With either `LimiterSession` or `LimiterAdapter`, rate limits are tracked separately for each host.
In other words, requests sent to one host will not count against the rate limit for any other hosts:

```python
session = LimiterSession(per_second=5)

# Make requests for two different hosts
for _ in range(10):
    response = session.get(f'https://httpbin.org/get')
    print(response.json())
    session.get(f'https://httpbingo.org/get')
    print(response.json())
```

If you have a case where multiple hosts share the same rate limit, you can disable this behavior
with the `per_host` option:
```python
session = LimiterSession(per_second=5, per_host=False)
```

### Per-Host Rate Limit Definitions
With `LimiterAdapter`, you can apply different rate limits to different hosts or URLs:
```python
# Apply a different set of rate limits (2/second and 100/minute) to a specific host
adapter_2 = LimiterAdapter(per_second=2, per_minute=100)
session.mount('https://api.some_site.com', adapter_2)
```

Behavior for matching requests is the same as other transport adapters: `requests` will use the
adapter with the most specific (i.e., longest) URL prefix that matches a given request. For example:
```python
session.mount('https://api.some_site.com/v1', adapter_3)
session.mount('https://api.some_site.com/v1/users', adapter_4)

# This request will use adapter_3
session.get('https://api.some_site.com/v1/')

# This request will use adapter_4
session.get('https://api.some_site.com/v1/users/1234')
```

### Rate Limit Error Handling
Sometimes, server-side rate limiting may not behave exactly as documented (or may not be documented
at all). Or you might encounter other scenarios where your client-side limit gets out of sync with
the server-side limit. Typically, a server will send a `429: Too Many Requests` response for an
exceeded rate limit.

When this happens, `requests-ratelimiter` will adjust its request log in an attempt to catch up to
the server-side limit. If a server sends a different status code other than 429 to indicate an
exceeded limit, you can set this with `limit_statuses`:
```python
session = LimiterSession(per_second=5, limit_statuses=[429, 500])
```

Or if you would prefer to disable this behavior and handle it yourself:
```python
session = LimiterSession(per_second=5, limit_statuses=[])
```

# Compatibility
There are many other useful libraries out there that add features to `requests`, most commonly by
extending or modifying
[requests.Session](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Session) or
[requests.HTTPAdapter](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter).

To use `requests-ratelimiter` with one of these libraries, you have a few different options:
1. If the library provides a custom `Session` class, mount a `LimiterAdapter` on it
2. Or use `LimiterMixin` to create a custom `Session` class with features from both libraries
3. If the library provides a custom `Adapter` class, use `LimiterMixin` to create a custom `Adapter`
   class with features from both libraries

## Custom Session Example: Requests-Cache
For example, to combine with [requests-cache](https://github.com/requests-cache/requests-cache), which
also includes a separate mixin class:
```python
from requests import Session
from requests_cache import CacheMixin, RedisCache
from requests_ratelimiter import LimiterMixin, RedisBucket


class CachedLimiterSession(CacheMixin, LimiterMixin, Session):
    """Session class with caching and rate-limiting behavior. Accepts arguments for both
    LimiterSession and CachedSession.
    """


# Optionally use Redis as both the bucket backend and the cache backend
session = CachedLimiterSession(
    per_second=5,
    bucket_class=RedisBucket,
    backend=RedisCache(),
)
```

This example has an extra benefit: cache hits won't count against your rate limit!
