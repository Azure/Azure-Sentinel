The EPV generates an xml Syslog message for every action taken against the Vault. The EPV will send the xml messages through the Sentinel.xsl translator to be converted into CEF standard format and sent to a syslog server of your choice (syslog-ng, rsyslog). The Log Analytics agent installed on your syslog staging server will import the messages into Azure Log Analytics. Refer to the [CyberArk documentation](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/PASIMP/DV-Integrating-with-SIEM-Applications.htm) for more guidance on SIEM integrations.\n\n This solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors were deprecated on **Aug 31, 2024**.",
