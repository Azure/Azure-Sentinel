The EPV will send the xml messages through the Microsoft Sentinel.xsl translator to be converted into CEF standard format and sent to a syslog staging server of your choice (syslog-ng, rsyslog). The Log Analytics agent installed on your syslog staging server will import the messages into Microsoft Log Analytics. Refer to the [CyberArk documentation](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/PASIMP/DV-Integrating-with-SIEM-Applications.htm) for more guidance on SIEM integrations.",
