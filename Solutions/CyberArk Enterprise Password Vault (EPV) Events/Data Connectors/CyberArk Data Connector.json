The EPV will send the xml messages through the Microsoft Sentinel.xsl translator to be converted into CEF standard format and sent to a syslog staging server of your choice (syslog-ng, rsyslog). The Log Analytics agent installed on your syslog staging server will import the messages into Microsoft Log Analytics.
