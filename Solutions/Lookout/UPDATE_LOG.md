## 🔧 Latest Update - November 18, 2025

### PR #13148 Validation Fix
**Commit**: `2dcbbd046c` - Fix ARM-TTK validation

**Issue**: PR failing with ARM-TTK validation errors
- Error: `workbook2-name` and `workbook3-name` parameters missing from createUiDefinition.json outputs

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added missing workbook output parameters to `Package/createUiDefinition.json`:
  - `workbook1-name`: "Lookout"
  - `workbook2-name`: "LookoutEventsV2"
  - `workbook3-name`: "LookoutSecurityInvestigationDashboard"
- ✅ Updated `Package/3.0.1.zip` with corrected files
- ✅ Local ARM-TTK validation: **All tests passed**
- ✅ KQL validation: **All Lookout rules valid** (errors in PR were from other solutions)

**Validation Commands Used**:
```bash
# ARM-TTK validation (with GitHub Actions filtering)
pwsh -Command "
Import-Module '/tmp/arm-ttk/arm-ttk/arm-ttk.psd1'
Test-AzTemplate -TemplatePath './Package' -File createUiDefinition.json
Test-AzTemplate -TemplatePath './Package' -File mainTemplate.json
"
```

**Files Modified**:
- `Package/createUiDefinition.json` - Added workbook parameters to outputs
- `Package/3.0.1.zip` - Updated with fixes

**Status**: Ready for Microsoft review ✅

## 🔧 Latest Update - November 18, 2025 (KQL Schema Fix)

### PR #13148 KQL Validation Fix
**Commit**: `aef274d8ba` - Fix KQL validation schema

**Issue**: KQL validation failing with "EventType does not refer to any known column"
- Schema file `.script/tests/KqlvalidationsTests/CustomTables/LookoutEvents.json` only had v1 fields
- Missing all v2 fields: EventType, ThreatSeverity, DeviceGuid, DeviceComplianceStatus, etc.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Updated `LookoutEvents.json` schema with complete v2 field set:
  - Core event fields: EventVendor, EventProduct, EventType, EventId, EventPriority
  - Device fields: DeviceGuid, DevicePlatform, DeviceSecurityStatus, DeviceComplianceStatus
  - Threat fields: ThreatId, ThreatType, ThreatSeverity, ThreatStatus, ThreatDescription
  - Smishing fields: SmishingAlertId, SmishingAlertType, SmishingAlertSeverity
  - Audit fields: AuditType, AuditAttributeChanges
  - MDM integration: MDMConnectorId, MDMExternalId
  - Legacy fields for backward compatibility

**Total Fields Added**: 90+ v2 fields to schema

**Status**: KQL validation should now pass ✅

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Deployment
- ✅ Deployed Lookout v2 solution via ARM template to Azure Sentinel
- ✅ Updated Lookout CCF data connector (fixed APIKey parameter bug)
- ✅ Data connector status: **Connected**
- ✅ Data flowing: 8 events (6 AUDIT, 2 THREAT - HIGH severity)
- ✅ Deployment name: `lookout-v2-deployment-20251103-172835`

### 2. Data Validation
- ✅ Raw data table: `LookoutMtdV2_CL`
- ✅ Event types confirmed: THREAT, AUDIT (v2 feature working!)
- ✅ Detected threat: Rogue WiFi "Mugshot Café Wi-fi" on frank.srp@gmail.com
- ✅ Last data received: 11/3/2025, 12:50:10 PM

### 3. Parser Fixed
- ✅ Identified data structure mismatch (uses `log_type` not `event_type`)
- ✅ Created working inline parser for queries
- ✅ Issue: Duplicate `LookoutEvents` function exists (needs cleanup)

### 4. Workbooks Created
- ✅ **Lookout CCF** - Basic workbook (deployed, has errors due to function conflict)
- ✅ **LookoutExecutiveDashboard.json** - Executive metrics dashboard
- ✅ **LookoutComprehensiveDashboard.json** - Full IOA/investigation dashboard

## 🔧 Critical Fixes Made

### Fix #1: APIKey Parameter Bug
**File**: `Data Connectors/LookoutStreamingConnector_ccp/LookoutStreaming_PollingConfig.json`
**Line**: 21
**Changed**:
```json
"APIKey": "[[parameters('applicationKey')]",  // WRONG
```
**To**:
```json
"APIKey": "[[parameters('applicationKey')]]", // FIXED
```

### Fix #2: Parser Data Structure
**Issue**: Deployed parser expects `event_type` but data uses `log_type`

**Working Parser** (use this in queries):
```kql
let ParsedLookoutEvents = 
    LookoutMtdV2_CL
    | extend 
        EventType = log_type,
        EventId = id,
        ThreatType = tostring(threat.type),
        ThreatSeverity = tostring(threat.severity),
        ThreatStatus = tostring(threat.status),
        DeviceEmailAddress = tostring(threat.device.email),
        DeviceGuid = tostring(threat.device.guid),
        ThreatNetworkSSID = tostring(threat.details.network_ssid),
        ActorType = tostring(actor.type),
        TargetType = tostring(target.type);
ParsedLookoutEvents
```

---

## 📊 Working Queries (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Query 1: Event Summary
```kql
let ParsedEvents = LookoutMtdV2_CL
    | extend EventType = log_type;
ParsedEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize count() by EventType, tostring(threat.severity)
```

### Query 2: High Severity Threats
```kql
let ParsedEvents = LookoutMtdV2_CL
    | extend 
        EventType = log_type,
        ThreatType = tostring(threat.type),
        ThreatSeverity = tostring(threat.severity),
        DeviceEmail = tostring(threat.device.email),
        ThreatDetails = tostring(threat.details.network_ssid);
ParsedEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where EventType == "THREAT"
| where ThreatSeverity in ("HIGH", "CRITICAL")
| project TimeGenerated, ThreatType, ThreatSeverity, DeviceEmail, ThreatDetails
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query 3: Audit Events (NEW v2 Feature)
```kql
let ParsedEvents = LookoutMtdV2_CL
    | extend 
        EventType = log_type,
        ActorType = tostring(actor.type),
        TargetType = tostring(target.type);
ParsedEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where EventType == "AUDIT"
| summarize count() by ActorType
```

### Query 4: Device Investigation
```kql
let ParsedEvents = LookoutMtdV2_CL
    | extend 
        EventType = log_type,
        DeviceEmail = tostring(threat.device.email),
        ThreatType = tostring(threat.type),
        ThreatSeverity = tostring(threat.severity);
ParsedEvents
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where DeviceEmail == "frank.srp@gmail.com"
| project TimeGenerated, EventType, ThreatType, ThreatSeverity
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
```

## 🚀 How to Redeploy Everything (If Deleted)

### Step 1: Redeploy Solution
```bash
# In Azure Cloud Shell
cd ~/Lookout/Package

SUBSCRIPTION_ID="a4b6a533-f801-49d5-ad81-719bc7264956"
RESOURCE_GROUP="lookout-sentinel-rg"
WORKSPACE_NAME="lookout-sentinel-ccf1"
LOCATION="eastus"

az account set --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID

az deployment group create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --template-file mainTemplate.json \
  --parameters workspace=$WORKSPACE_NAME location=$LOCATION \
  --name "lookout-v2-redeploy-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
```

### Step 2: Import Executive Dashboard
1. Go to Sentinel → Workbooks → + Add workbook
2. Click Edit → Advanced Editor
3. Delete all JSON
4. Copy content from `LookoutExecutiveDashboard.json`
5. Paste and click Apply
6. Save as "Lookout Executive Dashboard"

### Step 3: Import Comprehensive Dashboard
1. Repeat Step 2 with `LookoutComprehensiveDashboard.json`
2. Save as "Lookout IOA Investigation Dashboard"

   - **Fix**: Need to delete one of the duplicate functions

2. **Workbook "Lookout CCF" has errors** - due to function conflict
   - **Workaround**: Use the new comprehensive dashboards instead

## 📞 Support Information

### If Someone Deleted Your Workbook Again

1. **Check Audit Logs**:
   ```bash
   # In Azure Cloud Shell
   az monitor activity-log list \
     --resource-group lookout-sentinel-rg \
     --start-time 2025-11-03T00:00:00Z \
     --query "[?contains(operationName.value, 'workbooks')].{Time:eventTimestamp, User:caller, Operation:operationName.value, Status:status.value}" \
     --output table
   ```

2. **Redeploy from this directory**:
   - All dashboard JSON files are saved locally
   - Follow "How to Redeploy Everything" section above

3. **Lock the workbook**:
   - After redeploying, add a resource lock
   - Azure Portal → Resource Groups → lookout-sentinel-rg → Locks
   - Add "Read-only" or "Delete" lock
