# Microsoft Authentication Extensions for Python

The Microsoft Authentication Extensions for Python offers secure mechanisms for client applications to perform cross-platform token cache serialization and persistence. It gives additional support to the [Microsoft Authentication Library for Python (MSAL)](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python). 

MSAL Python supports an in-memory cache by default and provides the [SerializableTokenCache](https://msal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#msal.SerializableTokenCache) to perform cache serialization. You can read more about this in the MSAL Python [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-python-token-cache-serialization). Developers are required to implement their own cache persistance across multiple platforms and Microsoft Authentication Extensions makes this simpler.

The supported platforms are Windows, Mac and Linux. 
- Windows - [DPAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-use-data-protection) is used for encryption.
- MAC - The MAC KeyChain is used.
- Linux - [LibSecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) is used for encryption.

> Note: It is recommended to use this library for cache persistance support for Public client applications such as Desktop apps only. In web applications, this may lead to scale and performance issues. Web applications are recommended to persist the cache in session. Take a look at this [webapp sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-webapp).

## Installation

You can find Microsoft Authentication Extensions for Python on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/msal-extensions/).
1. If you haven't already, [install and/or upgrade the pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
   of your Python environment to a recent version. We tested with pip 18.1.
2. Run `pip install msal-extensions`.

## Versions

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

You can find the changes for each version under
[Releases](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-extensions-for-python/releases).

## Usage

The Microsoft Authentication Extensions library provides the `PersistedTokenCache` which accepts a platform-dependent persistence instance. This token cache can then be used to instantiate the `PublicClientApplication` in MSAL Python. 

The token cache includes a file lock, and auto-reload behavior under the hood.



Here is an example of this pattern for multiple platforms (taken from the complete [sample here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-extensions-for-python/blob/dev/sample/token_cache_sample.py)):

```python
def build_persistence(location, fallback_to_plaintext=False):
    """Build a suitable persistence instance based your current OS"""
    if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
        return FilePersistenceWithDataProtection(location)
    if sys.platform.startswith('darwin'):
        return KeychainPersistence(location, "my_service_name", "my_account_name")
    if sys.platform.startswith('linux'):
        try:
            return LibsecretPersistence(
                location,
                schema_name="my_schema_name",
                attributes={"my_attr1": "foo", "my_attr2": "bar"},
                )
        except:  # pylint: disable=bare-except
            if not fallback_to_plaintext:
                raise
            logging.exception("Encryption unavailable. Opting in to plain text.")
    return FilePersistence(location)

persistence = build_persistence("token_cache.bin")
print("Is this persistence encrypted?", persistence.is_encrypted)

cache = PersistedTokenCache(persistence)
```
Now you can use it in an MSAL application like this:
```python
app = msal.PublicClientApplication("my_client_id", token_cache=cache)
```
