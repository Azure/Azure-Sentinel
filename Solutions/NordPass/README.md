# NordPass Integration with Microsoft Sentinel

## Overview
This solution lets you monitor your organization’s user activities and track security incidents from NordPass’ Activity Log.

The benefits of this integration:
- **Enhanced Security Monitoring:** Detect unauthorized access and security risks.
- **Automated Threat Detection:** Receive real-time alerts on suspicious activities.
- **Centralized Activity Logging:** Maintain a comprehensive audit trail of user activities.

## Resources Created
Once you deploy the solution, the following Azure resources will be created:

<details>
<summary><strong>Azure Function</strong></summary>
An <strong>Azure Function</strong> is a serverless solution that synchronizes activity between NordPass and Microsoft Sentinel.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Storage Account</strong></summary>
A <strong>Storage Account</strong> contains Azure Function settings and configurations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Custom Table</strong></summary>
A <strong>Log Analytics Table</strong> named <code>NordPassEventLogs_CL</code> will be created to store synchronized activity events from NordPass. This table serves as the central repository for all collected log data.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Workbook</strong></summary>
A <strong>Workbook</strong> will be created to aggregate NordPass activity data for enhanced visualization and analysis. Dashboards in this workbook give insights into your user’s activity trends, security alerts, and compliance statuses.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Analytic Rules</strong></summary>
Multiple <strong>Analytic Rules</strong> will be created to facilitate incident escalation, allowing security teams to respond to threats proactively. 

These rules include:
- Users declining invites
- Bulk deletion of items
- Deleted users items were reassigned
- Invites, suspensions, and deletions by Owners or Admins
- Revoking tokens
- Failed login attempts by users
- Users exporting their vault

These rules help automate security monitoring, creating actionable insights for your organization.
