  "Description": "The [Palo Alto Networks (Firewall)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) Solution for Microsoft Sentinel allows you to easily connect your Palo Alto Networks Firewall logs with Microsoft Sentinel, to view dashboards, create custom alerts, and improve investigation. This gives you more insight into your organization's network and improves your security operation capabilities. This solution also contains playbooks to help in automated remediation.\n\nThis solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors are about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024**.",
