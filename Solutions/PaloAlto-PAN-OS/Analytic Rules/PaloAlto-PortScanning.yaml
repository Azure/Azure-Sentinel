name: Palo Alto - possible internal to external port scanning
description: |
  'Identifies a list of internal Source IPs (10.x.x.x Hosts) that have triggered 10 or more non-graceful tcp server resets from one or more Destination IPs which results in an "ApplicationProtocol = incomplete" designation. The server resets coupled with an "Incomplete" ApplicationProtocol designation can be an indication of internal to external port scanning or probing attack.
