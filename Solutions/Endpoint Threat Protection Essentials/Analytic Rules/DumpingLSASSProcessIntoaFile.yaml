name: Dumping LSASS Process Into a File
description: | 
  'Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).
  After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory.
  These credential materials can be harvested by an administrative user or system and used to conduct lateral movement using alternate authentication materials.
  As well as in-memory techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from the target host and analyzed on a local system.
