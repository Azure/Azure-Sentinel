    'This query detects attempts to delete backups, which could be ransomware activity to prevent file restoration and disrupt business services.'
description-detailed: |
   'This hunting query helps to detect attempts to delete backup. Though such an activity could be legitimate as part of regular business operations, often ransomware also perform such actions so that once the files are encrypted by them, backups cannot be used to restore encrypted files and thus causing interruption to regular business services.'
