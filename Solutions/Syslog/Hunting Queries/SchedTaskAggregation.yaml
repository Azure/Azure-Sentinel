    'This query aggregates and charts cron job data based on unique user-command pairs. It shows the frequency of commands, the number of computers they've run on, and their percentage of total tenant computers.'
description-detailed: |
  'This query aggregates information about all of the scheduled tasks (Cron jobs) and presents the data in a chart.
  The aggregation is done based on unique user-commandline pairs. It returns how many times a command line has
  been run from a particular user, how many computers that pair has run on, and what percentage that is of the
  total number of computers in the tenant.'
