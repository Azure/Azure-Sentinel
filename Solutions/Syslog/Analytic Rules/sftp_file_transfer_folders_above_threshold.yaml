name: SFTP File transfer folder count above threshold
description: |
  'Identifies SFTP File Transfers with distinct folder count above certain threshold in a 15min time period.
   It requires SFTP VERBOSE loglevel to be enabled.
   Please note that entity mapping for arrays is not supported, so when there is a single value in an array, we will pull that value from the array as a single string to populate the entity to support entity mapping features within Sentinel. Additionally, if the array is multivalued, we will input a string to indicate this with a unique hash so that matching will not occur.'
