name: SFTP File transfer above threshold
description: |
  'Identifies SFTP File Transfers above certain threshold in a 15min time period. It requires SFTP VERBOSE loglevel to be enabled.
   Please note that entity mapping for arrays is not supported, so when there is a single value in an array, we will pull that
   value from the array as a single string to populate the entity to support entity mapping features within Sentinel. Additionally,
   if the array is multivalued, we will input a string to indicate this with a unique hash so that matching will not occur.'
