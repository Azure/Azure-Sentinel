  User accounts may be created to achieve persistence on a machine.

  Query #1: Query for users being created using "net user" command.
  "net user" commands are noisy, so needs to be joined with another signal -.
  E.g. in this example we look for use of uncommon & undocumented commandline switches (e.g. /ad instead of /add).

  DeviceProcessEvents
  // Pro-tip: 
  // There are many different ways to run a process from a file - e.g. by using full path, env. variables, ~1 annotation, more...
  // So, to find executions of a known filename, better filter on the filename (and possibly on folder path) than on the commandline.
  | where FileName in~ ("net.exe", "net1.exe")
  // Parse the user name from the commandline.
  // To have case-insensitive parsing use the i flag, to have non-greedy match (e.g. CreatedUser as short as possible), specify U flag:
  // "kind=regex flags=i"
  | parse kind=regex flags=iU ProcessCommandLine with * "user " CreatedUser " " * "/ad"
  // Filter rows where user could not be parsed - e.g. because it was not a user command, or the /add commandline switch was not specified.
  | where isnotempty(CreatedUser)
  // Every net.exe executed will run net1.exe with the same commandline.
  // in this where clause we remove such rows, as they duplicate the number of results we have without adding any value.
  | where not (FileName =~ "net1.exe" and InitiatingProcessFileName =~ "net.exe" and replace("net", "net1", InitiatingProcessCommandLine) =~ ProcessCommandLine)
  // If /domain is specified, so the user is created on the domain controller.
  // Also, any prefix that's longer than 1 char will also do the same, e.g. /do, /dom, /doma, ....
