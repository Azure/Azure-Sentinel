name: Remote File Creation with PsExec
description: |
  This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Ryuk ransomware. There is also a related blog.
  Ryuk is human-operated ransomware. Much like DoppelPaymer ransomware, Ryuk is spread manually, often on networks that are already infected with Trickbot.
  Ryuk operators use PsExec to manually spread the ransomware to other devices.
  The following query detects remote file creation events that might indicate an active attack.
  The See also section below lists links to other queries associated with Ryuk ransomware.
