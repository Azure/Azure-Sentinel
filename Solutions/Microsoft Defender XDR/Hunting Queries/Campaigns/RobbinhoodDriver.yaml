  This query detects the presence of the Robbinhood ransomware driver.
description-detailed: |
  This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Ransomware continues to hit healthcare, critical services. There is also a related blog.
  Robbinhood is ransomware that has been involved in several high-profile incidents, including a 2019 attack on the city of Baltimore, Maryland. Robbinhood operators often employ a distinctive defense evasion technique, where they load a vulnerable driver on to a target and exploit it, in order to turn off security software -- essentially using the driver as malware.
  The following query detects if a device contains the vulnerable drivers. These are often, but not always, implanted on the target by operators seeking to use this technique to turn off security software.
  For a query that detects a later stage of this technique, see Detect security evasion related to the Robbinhood ransomware campaign.
