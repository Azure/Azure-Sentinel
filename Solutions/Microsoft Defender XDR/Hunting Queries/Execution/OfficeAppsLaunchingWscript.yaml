  The query searches for Office applications launching wscript.exe to run a JSE file.

  This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Trickbot: Pervasive & underestimated.
  Trickbot is a very prevalent piece of malware with an array of malicious capabilities. Originally designed to steal banking credentials, it has since evolved into a modular trojan that can deploy other malware, disable security software, and perform command-and-control (C2) operations.
  Trickbot is frequently spread through email. An attacker will send a target a message with an attachment containing a malicious macro. If the target enables the macro, it will write a JScript Encoded (JSE) file to disk (JScript is a Microsoft dialect of ECMAScript). The JSE file will then be launched using wscript.exe to perform a variety of malicious tasks, particularly reconnaissance.
  The following query detects when Office applications have launched wscript.exe to run a JSE file.
  See Detect rundll.exe being used for reconnaissance and command-and-control for another query related to Trickbot activity.
