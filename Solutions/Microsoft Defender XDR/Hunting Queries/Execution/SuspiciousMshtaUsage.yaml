  Microsoft HTML Applications, or HTAs, are executable files that use the same technologies and models as Internet Explorer, but do not run inside of a web browser.
  Mshta.exe is a Windows utility that provides a host for HTA files to run in. Although it has legitimate uses, attackers can use mshta.exe to run malicious Javascript or VBScript commands. The MITRE ATT&CK framework includes Mshta among its list of enterprise attack techniques.
  The following query detects when mshta.exe has been run, which might include illegitimate usage by attackers.
