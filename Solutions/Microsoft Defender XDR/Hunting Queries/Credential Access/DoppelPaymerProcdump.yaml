  This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Doppelpaymer: More human-operated ransomware. There is also a related blog.
  DoppelPaymer is ransomware that is spread manually by human operators. These operators have exhibited extensive knowledge of system administration and common network security misconfigurations. For example, they use SysInternal utilities such as ProcDump to dump credentials from LSASS. They often use these stolen credentials to turn off security software, run malicious commands, and spread malware throughout an organization.
  The following query detects ProcDump being used to dump credentials from LSASS.
