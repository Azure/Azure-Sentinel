  "Description": "The [Proofpoint TAP](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/advanced-threat-protection/targeted-attack-protection) solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables you to ingest Proofpoint TAP logs into Microsoft Sentinel.\n\n**Underlying Microsoft Technologies used:**\n\nThis solution takes a dependency on the following technologies, and some of these dependencies either may be in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) state or might result in additional ingestion or operational costs:\n\n a. [Azure Monitor HTTP Data Collector API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-collector-api) \n\n b. [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-collector-api)<p><span style='color:red; font-weight:bold;'>NOTE</span>: Microsoft recommends ingesting via Codeless Connector Platform based data connectors wherever possible. The CCP connector(s) included in this solution use the Log Ingestion API, which uses the Log Ingestion API, which replaces ingestion via the <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/custom-logs-migrate' style='color:#1890F1;'>deprecated HTTP Data Collector API</a>. CCP-based data connectors also support <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview' style='color:#1890F1;'>Data Collection Rules</a> (DCRs) offering transformations and enrichment.</p> <p><span style='color:red; font-weight:bold;'>Important</span>: While the updated connector(s) can coexist with their legacy versions, running them together will result in duplicated data ingestion. You can disable the legacy versions of these connectors to avoid duplication of data.</p>",
