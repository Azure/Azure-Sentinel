  "Description": "The [Proofpoint TAP](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/advanced-threat-protection/targeted-attack-protection) solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables you to ingest Proofpoint TAP logs into Microsoft Sentinel.\n\n**Underlying Microsoft Technologies used:**\n\nThis solution takes a dependency on the following technologies, and some of these dependencies either may be in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) state or might result in additional ingestion or operational costs:\n\n  a. [Log Ingestion API in Azure Monitor](https://aka.ms/Log-Ingestion-API)\r\n\n  b. [Microsoft Sentinel Codeless Connector Platform](https://aka.ms/Sentinel-CCP_Platform)<p><span style='color:red; font-weight:bold;'>NOTE</span>: Microsoft recommends installation of Proofpoint TAP (via Codeless Connector Platform). This connector is build on the Codeless Connector Platform (CCP), which uses the Log Ingestion API, which replaces ingestion via the <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/custom-logs-migrate' style='color:#1890F1;'>deprecated HTTP Data Collector API</a>. CCP-based data connectors also support <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview' style='color:#1890F1;'>Data Collection Rules</a> (DCRs) offering transformations and enrichment.</p> <p><span style='color:red; font-weight:bold;'>Important</span>: While the updated connector(s) can coexist with their legacy versions, running them together will result in duplicated data ingestion. You can disable the older versions of these connectors to avoid duplication of data..</p>",
