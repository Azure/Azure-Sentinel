TheHive can notify external system of modification events (case creation, alert update, task assignment) in real time. When a change occurs in the TheHive, an HTTPS POST request with event information is sent to a callback data connector URL.  Refer to [Webhooks documentation](https://docs.thehive-project.org/thehive/legacy/thehive3/admin/webhooks/) for more information. The connector provides ability to get events which helps to examine potential security risks, analyze your team's use of collaboration, diagnose configuration problems and more.",
