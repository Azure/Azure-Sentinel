  "Description": "[TheHive](http://thehive-project.org/) solution provides the capability to ingest common The Hive events into Microsoft Sentinel through Webhooks. The Hive can notify external system of modification events (case creation, alert update, task assignment) in real time. When a change occurs in The Hive, an HTTPS POST request with event information is sent to a callback data connector URL.  Refer to [Webhooks documentation](https://docs.thehive-project.org/thehive/legacy/thehive3/admin/webhooks/) for more information.\r\n \r\n**Underlying Microsoft Technologies used:**\n\nThis solution takes a dependency on the following technologies, and some of these dependencies either may be in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) state or might result in additional ingestion or operational costs: \r\n \r\n a. [Azure Monitor HTTP Data Collector API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-collector-api) b. [Azure Functions ](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/#overview)",
