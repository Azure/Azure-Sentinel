# Recorded Future Intelligence for Microsoft Sentinel

## Prerequisites  

### Solution Dependencies  

The **Threat Intelligence** solution from Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub must be installed for indicators to be forwarded to Microsoft Sentinel ThreatIntelligenceIndicator log table. The Threat Intelligence Solution contains both the _deprecated_ **Threat Intelligence Platforms Data Connector** and the new **Threat Intelligence Upload Indicators API**.

### Roles and Permissions

Microsoft article that describes roles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/roles" target="_blank">Roles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel</a>


During installation, permissions are required on the resource group level to use and authorize the playbooks. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#microsoft-sentinel-contributor" target="_blank">Microsoft Sentinel Contributor</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#logic-app-contributor" target="_blank">Logic App Contributor</a>.

Alternative use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview" target="_blank">managed identity</a> authorization for playbook. The user performing the installation needs to have the role of **Owner** or **Role Based Access Control Administrator** on resource group level.

### Connectors Authorization 
Each connector need to be authorized after playbook/logic app installation. Expand all nodes in the logic app after installation and look for blocks marked with a warning sign. Open and authorize all connections.

Recorded Future requires API keys to communicate with our API.

## Ingestion and Operational costs
Playbook(Logic apps) may result in additional ingestion or operational costs:

1. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing" target="_blank">Usage metering, billing, and pricing for Azure Logic Apps</a>

1. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs" target="_blank">Azure Monitor Logs cost calculations and options</a>

Recorded Futures risk lists are generated at different cadences as described in this support article <a href="https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010401968-Risk-List-Download-Recommendations" target="_blank">Risk List Download Recommendations</a> (Require Recorded Future Login). It is possible to adjust cadence to decrease cost of data processing.

# Installation

The recommended way of installing the solution is via Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub, as it will provide templates for Playbooks, Workbooks and Analytic Rules.

It is possible to install specific playbooks as specified in the [Playbooks](#playbooks) section, as there are some playbooks not included in the content pack. This information is specified in their respective READMEs. Installing a specific playbook is a way to get bugfixes for a specific module.


## 1. Content Hub Installation

1. Locate the `Recorded Future Intelligence Solution` in Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub.
![](Images/2023-04-18-08-39-58.png)
Press **Install**  and continue to configure the solution. 

> [!NOTE] 
> The Content Hub installation provides templates and you have to create playbooks, workbooks, and analytic rules based on the templates. 

![](Images/2023-11-20-12-13-25.png)

When installing playbooks from templates, read the description and look for dependencies that have to be installed. 

Example, install a custom connector that is included in the solution together with the playbook. Read the documentation for each playbook in sub folders listed [here](#playbooks)

![](Images/2023-11-20-12-34-15.png)

After pressing the "Create Playbook" specify Subscription, Resource Group and Workspace. This is needed when installing any of the Playbooks.

<summary>Expand image</summary>

![Workbooks](images/analyticrules.png)
</details>

When creating Analytic Rules from templates, modify the provided KQL to match you infrastructure. The KQL query below is an example where the ASIM imNetworkSession table can be exchanged for any table containing outgoing IP traffic in your infrastructure. 

```JS
let ioc_lookBack = 1d;
// The source table (ASimNetworkSessionLogs) can be replaced by any infrastructure table containing ip data.
// The following workbook: Recorded Future - IP Correlation will help researching available data and selecting tables and columns  
imNetworkSession
| where isnotempty(DstIpAddr)
| join kind=inner (
ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
// Only look for IOCs
| where isnotempty(NetworkIP)
// Only look at Recorded Future Threat Hunt Indicators.
| where Description startswith "Recorded Future - Threat Hunt"
// Only work with the latest indicators  
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(ioc_lookBack)
| summarize LatestIndicatorTime = arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by IndicatorId
| where Active == true and ExpirationDateTime > now()
) on $left.DstIpAddr == $right.NetworkIP
// select column from the source table to match with Recorded Future ThreatIntelligenceIndicator $left.DstIpAddr
| mv-expand RecordedFuturePortalLink=parse_json(tostring(parse_json(Tags)[0]))['RecordedFuturePortalLink']
| project NetworkIP, Description, Type, TimeGenerated, RecordedFuturePortalLink
```

The following Analytic rules are provided in the Solution. All of them requires configuration and adaption to your infrastructure. 

|User Case|Analytic Rule|
|-|-|
|Detect|DomainMalwareC2inDNSEvents|
|Detect|DomainMalwareC2inSyslogEvents|
|Detect|HashObservedInUndergroundinCommonSecurityLog|
|Detect|IPMalwareC2inAzureActivityEvents|
|Detect|IPMalwareC2inDNSEvents|
|Detect|UrlReportedbyInsiktGroupinSyslogEvents|
|Threat Hunt|RecordedFutureThreatHuntingHashAllActors|
|Threat Hunt|RecordedFutureThreatHuntingIPAllActors|
|Threat Hunt|RecordedFutureThreatHuntingDomainAllActors|
|Threat Hunt|RecordedFutureThreatHuntingUrlAllActors|


# Upgrade from previous versions
Information about latest released version number can be found in Recorded Future Intelligence Solution [release notes](../ReleaseNotes.md). There can be delay to the version available inside the content hub and whats in listed here due to publish/rollout time.  

### From version 2.4
We are deprecating the RecordedFuture-ImportToSentinel and all *-TIProcessor playbooks. Going forward, install the new IndicatorImport playbooks and configure them to download you selection of risk lists. Use the same risk lists being downloaded today, same cadence, and use the same description using the TIProcessor playbooks. Use the same description for threat indicators if you have analytic rules set up for alerting. 

Our support will end when Microsoft shut down the underlying API. More information can be found on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/understand-threat-intelligence#add-threat-indicators-to-microsoft-sentinel-with-the-threat-intelligence-platforms-data-connector" target="_blank">Microsoft Learn</a> (No end date has communicated from Microsoft at this point November 2023).

### From version 1
If you have a version 1 installation you need to first acquire a V2 APi key from Recorded Future. Install the new all IndicatorImport and enrichment -playbooks. Select a different name than the once already installed and reauthenticate them. Configure the IndicatorImport playbooks to pull your selection of risk lists. After validating that the new playbooks works as expected you can deactivate the V1 versions. 

# Troubleshooting

## Query Risk Lists
After successfully running and importing one or more Risk Lists it is possible to query the imported data in your Log Analytics Workspace. 

Example queries:  
``` sql 
//  List 10 rows from ThreatIntelligenceIndicator log imported from Recorded Future
ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
| where Description contains "Recorded Future"
| take 10

// List 10 rows from ThreatIntelligenceIndicator log imported from the  
// IP - Actively Communicating C&C Server Risk List 
ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
|where Description == "Recorded Future - IP - Actively Communicating C&C Server"
| take 10

//  List 10 rows from ThreatIntelligenceIndicator log imported from Recorded Future
ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
|where Description == "Recorded Future - IP - Actively Communicating C&C Server" and AdditionalInformation contains "Cobalt Strike"
| take 10
```

## "Errors" in RecordedFuture-IOC_Enrichment
If Recorded Future is missing data for a specific entity, when viewed within the Logic App "Previous Run" section, a error might be seen.

<details>
<summary> Example of "phantom error" </summary>

![alt text](Images/ioc_enrichment_error_not.png)
</details>
</br>

If the last box (Add Comment to incident (V3)) is green, then a comment has been created on the incident explaining what has happened.

If `http://` or `https://` is missing from URL entities, we will add `https://` to our URL Enrichment.


### Report issues/errors

When reporting issues or errors to Recorded Future on logic apps. Please include logic app version identifier that can be found in the `<Logic App> -> Development Tools -> Versions` section in the Azure portal.

![alt text](Images/LogicAppVersion.png)

# Known Issues 
## Version 3.0
Microsoft Sentinel playbook upgrade experience can result in the following error: ```Cannot read properties of null (reading 'parameters')```
![](Images/2023-09-13-19-16-24.png)

A workaround is to reinstall and overwrite the playbooks from the template in Playbook Template tab and not using the upgrade wizard. Before overwriting an active playbook make note of the risk list downloaded, the description, cadence of downloading.
