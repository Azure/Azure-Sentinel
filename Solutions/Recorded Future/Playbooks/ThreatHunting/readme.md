# Recorded Future Automated Threat Hunting

Information about Recorded Future Intelligence Solution for Microsoft Sentinel can be found in the main [readme](../readme.md).

## Recorded Future Automated Threat Hunt 
Threat hunting is the proactive and iterative process of searching for and detecting cyber threats that have evaded traditional security measures, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems. It involves using a combination of manual and automated techniques to identify and investigate potential security breaches and intrusions within an organization's network.

Fetch indicators linked to threat actors from the threat actor map. The logic app will run on a schedule and check threat actor related to the client’s Recorded Future threat map. It is possible to set a risk score threshold, so that if a threat actor score exceeds the score. The logic app will query Recorded Future for all relevant links indicators (IPs, Hashes, Domains, and URLs) tied to threat actors and store them in the ThreatIntelligenceIndicator table.

If recurrence is changed from default (24h), also change `valid_until_delta_hours` to avoid duplicates in ThreatIntelligenceIndicator table leading to multiple incidents created.

After successful installation, automate incidents creation by setup Analytic Rules shipped in the Solution to correlate this data with your infrastructure, described [here](../readme.md#analytic-rules). Automate triage of incidents by install and configure [Recorded Future Enrichment](../Enrichment/readme.md#recordedfuture-ioc_enrichment).
