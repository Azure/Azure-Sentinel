    "Description": "Cybercriminals continue to utilize stolen corporate credentials as the number one technique for account takeover (ATO). In fact, the FBI estimated that this resulted in estimated losses totaling more than $2.7 billion in 2022. SpyCloud helps prevent account takeover and ransomware attacks by identifying exposed credentials related to a company’s domains, IP addresses and emails. Through this integration, breach and malware data from SpyCloud can be loaded into Sentinel.",
