## Post Deployment Instructions
### Authorize connections
Once deployment is complete, you will need to authorize each connection:
- As a best practice, we have used the Sentinel connection in Logic Apps that use "ManagedSecurityIdentity" permissions. Please refer to [this document](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/what-s-new-managed-identity-for-azure-sentinel-logic-apps/ba-p/2068204) and provide permissions to the Logic App accordingly.
- Provide connection details for the SpyCloud Enterprise Custom Connector.
- Save the Logic App. If the Logic App prompts any missing connections, please update the connections similarly.
### b.Configurations in Sentinel:
- In Microsoft Sentinel, configure the SpyCloud Breach rule automation rules to trigger this playbook.
