## Overview
This playbook gets triggered when an incident is created from the "SpyCloud Malware Rule" and can perform the following actions

- Check if the hostname is a managed asset. If no hostname exists in the record, skip this check. 
- For the specific machine ID, if the organization has access to compass data, pull all the additional records for the specific machine ID from the appropriate compass endpoint and add them to the incident. 
- Escalate the incident for someone to handle the malware infection.

## Post Deployment Instructions
### Authorize connections
Once deployment is complete, you will need to authorize each connection:
- As a best practice, we have used the Sentinel connection in Logic Apps that use "ManagedSecurityIdentity" permissions. Please refer to [this document](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/what-s-new-managed-identity-for-azure-sentinel-logic-apps/ba-p/2068204) and provide permissions to the Logic App accordingly.
- Provide connection details for the SpyCloud Enterprise Custom Connector.
- Save the Logic App. If the Logic App prompts any missing connections, please update the connections similarly.
### b.Configurations in Sentinel:
- In Azure Sentinel, configure the SpyCloud Malware rule automation rules to trigger this playbook.
