name: SAP - (Preview) File Downloaded From a Malicious IP Address
description: |
    User has downloaded a file from an SAP system using an IP address known to be malicious.
    Malicious IP addresses are obtained from threat intelligence services. For additional information visit the [Connect your threat intelligence platform to Microsoft Sentinel]( https://learn.microsoft.com/Azure/sentinel/connect-threat-intelligence-tip) how-to page.
    This Alert rule allows for a cross-workspace query to accommodate an architecture where the threat intelligence data resides in a different workspace than the one which holds the SAP data.
