# Azure Storage File Share client library for Python
Azure File Share storage offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard [Server Message Block (SMB) protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/microsoft-smb-protocol-and-cifs-protocol-overview). Azure file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS. Additionally, Azure file shares can be cached on Windows Servers with Azure File Sync for fast access near where the data is being used.

Azure file shares can be used to:

* Replace or supplement on-premises file servers
* "Lift and shift" applications
* Simplify cloud development with shared application settings, diagnostic share, and Dev/Test/Debug tools

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* Python 2.7, or 3.5 or later is required to use this package.
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and an
[Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) to use this package.

### Install the package
Install the Azure Storage File Share client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-storage-file-share
```

### Create a storage account
If you wish to create a new storage account, you can use the
[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal),
[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-powershell),
or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-cli):

```bash
# Create a new resource group to hold the storage account -
# if using an existing resource group, skip this step
az group create --name my-resource-group --location westus2

# Create the storage account
az storage account create -n my-storage-account-name -g my-resource-group
```

### Create the client
The Azure Storage File Share client library for Python allows you to interact with four types of resources: the storage
account itself, file shares, directories, and files. Interaction with these resources starts with an instance of a
[client](#clients). To create a client object, you will need the storage account's file service URL and a
credential that allows you to access the storage account:

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient

service = ShareServiceClient(account_url="https://<my-storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net/", credential=credential)
```

#### Looking up the account URL
You can find the storage account's file service URL using the
[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#storage-account-endpoints),
[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageaccount),
or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-storage-account-show):

```bash
# Get the file service URL for the storage account
az storage account show -n my-storage-account-name -g my-resource-group --query "primaryEndpoints.file"
```

#### Types of credentials
The `credential` parameter may be provided in a number of different forms, depending on the type of
[authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth) you wish to use:
1. To use a [shared access signature (SAS) token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview),
   provide the token as a string. If your account URL includes the SAS token, omit the credential parameter.
   You can generate a SAS token from the Azure Portal under "Shared access signature" or use one of the `generate_sas()`
   functions to create a sas token for the storage account, share, or file:

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient, generate_account_sas, ResourceTypes, AccountSasPermissions

    sas_token = generate_account_sas(
        account_name="<storage-account-name>",
        account_key="<account-access-key>",
        resource_types=ResourceTypes(service=True),
        permission=AccountSasPermissions(read=True),
        expiry=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)
    )

    share_service_client = ShareServiceClient(account_url="https://<my_account_name>.file.core.windows.net", credential=sas_token)
    ```

2. To use a storage account [shared key](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/authenticate-with-shared-key/)
   (aka account key or access key), provide the key as a string. This can be found in the Azure Portal under the "Access Keys" 
   section or by running the following Azure CLI command:

    ```az storage account keys list -g MyResourceGroup -n MyStorageAccount```

    Use the key as the credential parameter to authenticate the client:
    ```python
    from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient
    service = ShareServiceClient(account_url="https://<my_account_name>.file.core.windows.net", credential="<account_access_key>")
    ```

#### Creating the client from a connection string
Depending on your use case and authorization method, you may prefer to initialize a client instance with a storage
connection string instead of providing the account URL and credential separately. To do this, pass the storage
connection string to the client's `from_connection_string` class method:

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient

connection_string = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=xxxx;AccountKey=xxxx;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
service = ShareServiceClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=connection_string)
```

The connection string to your storage account can be found in the Azure Portal under the "Access Keys" section or by running the following CLI command:

```bash
az storage account show-connection-string -g MyResourceGroup -n MyStorageAccount
```

## Key concepts
The following components make up the Azure File Share Service:
* The storage account itself
* A file share within the storage account
* An optional hierarchy of directories within the file share
* A file within the file share, which may be up to 1 TiB in size

The Azure Storage File Share client library for Python allows you to interact with each of these components through the
use of a dedicated client object.

### Clients
Four different clients are provided to interact with the various components of the File Share Service:
1. [ShareServiceClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-fileshare-shareserviceclient) -
    this client represents interaction with the Azure storage account itself, and allows you to acquire preconfigured
    client instances to access the file shares within. It provides operations to retrieve and configure the service
    properties as well as list, create, and delete shares within the account. To perform operations on a specific share,
    retrieve a client using the `get_share_client` method.
2. [ShareClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-fileshare-shareclient) -
    this client represents interaction with a specific file share (which need not exist yet), and allows you to acquire
    preconfigured client instances to access the directories and files within. It provides operations to create, delete,
    configure, or create snapshots of a share and includes operations to create and enumerate the contents of
    directories within it. To perform operations on a specific directory or file, retrieve a client using the
    `get_directory_client` or `get_file_client` methods.
3. [ShareDirectoryClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-fileshare-sharedirectoryclient) -
    this client represents interaction with a specific directory (which need not exist yet). It provides operations to
    create, delete, or enumerate the contents of an immediate or nested subdirectory, and includes operations to create
    and delete files within it. For operations relating to a specific subdirectory or file, a client for that entity can
    also be retrieved using the `get_subdirectory_client` and `get_file_client` functions.
4. [ShareFileClient](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-fileshare-sharefileclient) -
    this client represents interaction with a specific file (which need not exist yet). It provides operations to
    upload, download, create, delete, and copy a file.

For details on path naming restrictions, see [Naming and Referencing Shares, Directories, Files, and Metadata](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-shares--directories--files--and-metadata).

## Examples
The following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Storage File Share tasks, including:

* [Creating a file share](#creating-a-file-share "Creating a file share")
* [Uploading a file](#uploading-a-file "Uploading a file")
* [Downloading a file](#downloading-a-file "Downloading a file")
* [Listing contents of a directory](#listing-contents-of-a-directory "Listing contents of a directory")

### Creating a file share
Create a file share to store your files

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareClient

share = ShareClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="my_share")
share.create_share()
```

Use the async client to create a file share

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare.aio import ShareClient

share = ShareClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="my_share")
await share.create_share()
```

### Uploading a file
Upload a file to the share

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareFileClient

file_client = ShareFileClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="my_share", file_path="my_file")

with open("./SampleSource.txt", "rb") as source_file:
    file_client.upload_file(source_file)
```

Upload a file asynchronously

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare.aio import ShareFileClient

file_client = ShareFileClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="my_share", file_path="my_file")

with open("./SampleSource.txt", "rb") as source_file:
    await file_client.upload_file(source_file)
```

### Downloading a file
Download a file from the share

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareFileClient

file_client = ShareFileClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="my_share", file_path="my_file")

with open("DEST_FILE", "wb") as file_handle:
    data = file_client.download_file()
    data.readinto(file_handle)
```

Download a file asynchronously

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare.aio import ShareFileClient

file_client = ShareFileClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="my_share", file_path="my_file")

with open("DEST_FILE", "wb") as file_handle:
    data = await file_client.download_file()
    await data.readinto(file_handle)
```

### Listing contents of a directory
List all directories and files under a parent directory

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareDirectoryClient

parent_dir = ShareDirectoryClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="my_share", directory_path="parent_dir")

my_list = list(parent_dir.list_directories_and_files())
print(my_list)
```

List contents of a directory asynchronously

```python
from azure.storage.fileshare.aio import ShareDirectoryClient

parent_dir = ShareDirectoryClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="<connection_string>", share_name="my_share", directory_path="parent_dir")

my_files = []
async for item in parent_dir.list_directories_and_files():
    my_files.append(item)
print(my_files)
```

## Optional Configuration

Optional keyword arguments that can be passed in at the client and per-operation level. 

### Retry Policy configuration

Use the following keyword arguments when instantiating a client to configure the retry policy:

* __retry_total__ (int): Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.
Pass in `retry_total=0` if you do not want to retry on requests. Defaults to 10.
* __retry_connect__ (int): How many connection-related errors to retry on. Defaults to 3.
* __retry_read__ (int): How many times to retry on read errors. Defaults to 3.
* __retry_status__ (int): How many times to retry on bad status codes. Defaults to 3.
* __retry_to_secondary__ (bool): Whether the request should be retried to secondary, if able.
This should only be enabled of RA-GRS accounts are used and potentially stale data can be handled.
Defaults to `False`.

### Other client / per-operation configuration

Other optional configuration keyword arguments that can be specified on the client or per-operation.

**Client keyword arguments:**

* __connection_timeout__ (int): Optionally sets the connect and read timeout value, in seconds.
* __transport__ (Any): User-provided transport to send the HTTP request.

**Per-operation keyword arguments:**

* __raw_response_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the response returned from the service.
* __raw_request_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the request before being sent to service.
* __client_request_id__ (str): Optional user specified identification of the request.
* __user_agent__ (str): Appends the custom value to the user-agent header to be sent with the request.
* __logging_enable__ (bool): Enables logging at the DEBUG level. Defaults to False. Can also be passed in at
the client level to enable it for all requests.
* __headers__ (dict): Pass in custom headers as key, value pairs. E.g. `headers={'CustomValue': value}`


## Troubleshooting
### General
Storage File clients raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).

This list can be used for reference to catch thrown exceptions. To get the specific error code of the exception, use the `error_code` attribute, i.e, `exception.error_code`.

### Logging
This library uses the standard
[logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) library for logging.
Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFO
level.

Detailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredacted
headers, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` argument:
```python
import sys
import logging
from azure.storage.fileshare import ShareServiceClient

# Create a logger for the 'azure.storage.fileshare' SDK
logger = logging.getLogger('azure.storage.fileshare')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Configure a console output
handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
logger.addHandler(handler)

# This client will log detailed information about its HTTP sessions, at DEBUG level
service_client = ShareServiceClient.from_connection_string("your_connection_string", logging_enable=True)
```

Similarly, `logging_enable` can enable detailed logging for a single operation,
even when it isn't enabled for the client:
```py
service_client.get_service_properties(logging_enable=True)
```

## 12.0.0b5

**Important: This package was previously named azure-storage-file**

Going forward, to use this SDK, please install `azure-storage-file-share`.
Additionally:
- The namespace within the package has also been renamed to `azure.storage.fileshare`.
- `FileServiceClient` has been renamed to `ShareServiceClient`.
- `DirectoryClient` has been renamed to `ShareDirectoryClient`.
- `FileClient` has been renamed to `ShareFileClient`.

**Additional Breaking changes**

- `ShareClient` now accepts only `account_url` with mandatory a string param `share_name`.
To use a share_url, the method `from_share_url` must be used.
- `ShareDirectoryClient` now accepts only `account_url` with mandatory string params `share_name` and `directory_path`.
To use a directory_url, the method `from_directory_url` must be used.
- `ShareFileClient` now accepts only `account_url` with mandatory string params `share_name` and
`file_path`. To use a file_url, the method `from_file_url` must be used.
- `file_permission_key` parameter has been renamed to `permission_key`
- `set_share_access_policy` has required parameter `signed_identifiers`.
- `NoRetry` policy has been removed. Use keyword argument `retry_total=0` for no retries.
- Removed types that were accidentally exposed from two modules. Only `ShareServiceClient`, `ShareClient`, `ShareDirectoryClient` and `ShareFileClient` should be imported from azure.storage.fileshare.aio
- Some parameters have become keyword only, rather than positional. Some examples include:
  - `loop`
  - `max_concurrency`
  - `validate_content`
  - `timeout` etc.
- Client and model files have been made internal. Users should import from the top level modules `azure.storage.fileshare` and `azure.storage.fileshare.aio` only.
- The `generate_shared_access_signature` methods on each of `ShareServiceClient`, `ShareClient` and `ShareFileClient` have been replaced by module level functions `generate_account_sas`, `generate_share_sas` and `generate_file_sas`.
- `start_range` and `end_range` params are now renamed to and behave like`offset` and `length` in
the following APIs:
  - download_file
  - upload_range
  - upload_range_from_url
  - clear_range
  - get_ranges
- `StorageStreamDownloader` is no longer iterable. To iterate over the file data stream, use `StorageStreamDownloader.chunks`.
- The public attributes of `StorageStreamDownloader` have been limited to:
  - `name` (str): The name of the file.
  - `path` (str): The full path of the file.
  - `share` (str): The share the file will be downloaded from.
  - `properties` (`FileProperties`): The properties of the file.
  - `size` (int): The size of the download. Either the total file size, or the length of a subsection if sepcified. Previously called `download_size`.
- `StorageStreamDownloader` now has new functions:
  - `readall()`: Reads the complete download stream, returning bytes. This replaces the functions `content_as_bytes` and `content_as_text` which have been deprecated.
  - `readinto(stream)`: Download the complete stream into the supplied writable stream, returning the number of bytes written. This replaces the function `download_to_stream` which has been deprecated.
- `ShareFileClient.close_handles` and `ShareDirectoryClient.close_handles` have both been replaced by two functions each; `close_handle(handle)` and `close_all_handles()`. These functions are blocking and return integers (the number of closed handles) rather than polling objects.
- `get_service_properties` now returns a dict with keys consistent to `set_service_properties`

**New features**

- `ResourceTypes`, `NTFSAttributes`, and `Services` now have method `from_string` which takes parameters as a string.


## 12.0.0b4

**Breaking changes**

- Permission models.
  - `AccountPermissions`, `SharePermissions` and `FilePermissions` have been renamed to
  `AccountSasPermissions`, `ShareSasPermissions` and `FileSasPermissions` respectively.
  - enum-like list parameters have been removed from all three of them.
  - `__add__` and `__or__` methods are removed.
- `max_connections` is now renamed to `max_concurrency`.

**New features**

- `AccountSasPermissions`, `FileSasPermissions`, `ShareSasPermissions` now have method `from_string` which
takes parameters as a string.

## 12.0.0b3

**New features**
- Added upload_range_from_url API to write the bytes from one Azure File endpoint into the specified range of another Azure File endpoint.
- Added set_http_headers for directory_client, create_permission_for_share and get_permission_for_share APIs.
- Added optional parameters for smb properties related parameters for create_file*, create_directory* related APIs and set_http_headers API.
- Updated get_properties for directory and file so that the response has SMB properties.

**Dependency updates**
- Adopted [azure-core](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/) 1.0.0b3
  - If you later want to revert to previous versions of azure-storage-file, or another Azure SDK
  library requiring azure-core 1.0.0b1 or azure-core 1.0.0b2, you must explicitly install
  the specific version of azure-core as well. For example:

  `pip install azure-core==1.0.0b2 azure-storage-file==12.0.0b2`

**Fixes and improvements**
- Fix where content-type was being added in the request when not mentioned explicitly.


## 12.0.0b2

**Breaking changes**
- Renamed `copy_file_from_url` to `start_copy_from_url` and changed behaviour to return a dictionary of copy properties rather than a polling object. Status of the copy operation can be retrieved with the `get_file_properties` operation.
- Added `abort_copy` operation to the `FileClient` class. This replaces the previous abort operation on the copy status polling operation.
- The behavior of listing operations has been modified:
    - The previous `marker` parameter has been removed.
    - The iterable response object now supports a `by_page` function that will return a secondary iterator of batches of results. This function supports a `continuation_token` parameter to replace the previous `marker` parameter.
- The new listing behaviour is also adopted by the `receive_messages` operation:
    - The receive operation returns a message iterator as before.
    - The returned iterator supports a `by_page` operation to receive messages in batches.

**New features**
- Added async APIs to subnamespace `azure.storage.file.aio`.
- Distributed tracing framework OpenCensus is now supported.

**Dependency updates**
- Adopted [azure-core](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/) 1.0.0b2
  - If you later want to revert to azure-storage-file 12.0.0b1, or another Azure SDK
  library requiring azure-core 1.0.0b1, you must explicitly install azure-core
  1.0.0b1 as well. For example:

  `pip install azure-core==1.0.0b1 azure-storage-file==12.0.0b1`

**Fixes and improvements**
- Fix for closing file handles - continuation token was not being passed to subsequent calls.
- General refactor of duplicate and shared code.


## 12.0.0b1

Version 12.0.0b1 is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly and Pythonic client library for Azure Storage Files. For more information about this, and preview releases of other Azure SDK libraries, please visit
https://aka.ms/azure-sdk-preview1-python.

**Breaking changes: New API design**
- Operations are now scoped to a particular client:
    - `FileServiceClient`: This client handles account-level operations. This includes managing service properties and listing the shares within an account.
    - `ShareClient`: The client handles operations for a particular share. This includes creating or deleting that share, as well as listing the directories within that share, and managing properties and metadata.
    - `DirectoryClient`: The client handles operations for a particular directory. This includes creating or deleting that directory, as well as listing the files and subdirectories, and managing properties and metadata.
    - `FileClient`: The client handles operations for a particular file. This includes creating or deleting that file, as well as upload and download data and managing properties.

    These clients can be accessed by navigating down the client hierarchy, or instantiated directly using URLs to the resource (account, share, directory or file).
    For full details on the new API, please see the [reference documentation](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-python/storage.html#azure-storage-file-share).
- The copy file operation now returns a polling object that can be used to check the status of the operation, as well as abort the operation.
- The `close_handles` operation now return a polling object that can be used to check the status of the operation.
- Download operations now return a streaming object that can download data in multiple ways:
    - Iteration: The streamer is an iterable object that will download and yield the content in chunks. Only supports single threaded download.
    - `content_as_bytes`: Return the entire file content as bytes. Blocking operation that supports multi-threaded download.
    - `content_as_text`: Return the entire file content as decoded text. Blocking operation that supports multi-threaded download.
    - `download_to_stream`: Download the entire content to an open stream handle (e.g. an open file). Supports multi-threaded download.
- New underlying REST pipeline implementation, based on the new `azure.core` library.
- Client and pipeline configuration is now available via keyword arguments at both the client level, and per-operation. See reference documentation for a full list of optional configuration arguments.
- New error hierarchy:
    - All service errors will now use the base type: `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError`
    - The are a couple of specific exception types derived from this base type for common error scenarios:
        - `ResourceNotFoundError`: The resource (e.g. queue, message) could not be found. Commonly a 404 status code.
        - `ResourceExistsError`: A resource conflict - commonly caused when attempting to create a resource that already exists.
        - `ResourceModifiedError`: The resource has been modified (e.g. overwritten) and therefore the current operation is in conflict. Alternatively this may be raised if a condition on the operation is not met.
        - `ClientAuthenticationError`: Authentication failed.
- Operation `set_file_properties` has been renamed to `set_http_headers`.
- Operations `get_file_to_<output>` have been replaced with `download_file`. See above for download output options.
- Operations `create_file_from_<input>` have been replace with `upload_file`.
- Operations `get_share_acl` and `set_share_acl` have been renamed to `get_share_access_policy` and `set_share_access_policy`.
- Operation `set_share_properties` has been renamed to `set_share_quota`.
- Operation `snapshot_share` has been renamed to `create_snapshot`.
- Operation `copy_file` has been renamed to `copy_file_from_url`.
- No longer have specific operations for `get_metadata` - use `get_properties` instead.
- No longer have specific operations for `exists` - use `get_properties` instead.
- Operation `update_range` has been renamed to `upload_range`.
