description: |
  'JNDI injection is a malicious technique where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to influence the server used in a JNDI lookup. Where an attacker can influence the server the JNDI Lookup is sent to, it is possible to get the server to connect to a malicious JNDI Server which returns a malicious class which when loaded will give the attacker Remote Code Execution on the impacted server. Also in the case of infamous log4shell vulnerability, as well as RCE, it is possible to exfiltrate data fro the impacted server.'
