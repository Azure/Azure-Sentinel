  'Serialization refers to the process of converting an object into a format which can be saved to a file or a datastore. Deserialization reverses this process, transforming serialized data coming from a file, stream, or network socket into an object.Untrusted Deserialization is a web application vulnerability that enables attackers to pass arbitrary objects or code to a deserializer. In this kind of attack, untrusted data abuses the logic of an application to inflict a denial of service (DoS) attack, achieve authentication bypass, enable remote code execution, and even execute arbitrary code as it is being deserialized.'
