  'Expression Language Injection works by taking advantage of server-side code injection vulnerabilities which occur whenever an application incorporates user-controllable data into a string that is dynamically evaluated by a code interpreter. This can lead to complete compromise of the application's data and functionality, as well as the server that is hosting the application.'
