  'Path traversal attacks use an affected application to gain unauthorized access to server file system folders that are higher in the directory hierarchy than the web root folder. A successful path traversal attack can fool a web application into reading and consequently exposing the contents of files outside of the document root directory of the application or the web server, including credentials for back-end systems, application code and data, and sensitive operating system files. If successful this can lead to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, and remote code execution.'
