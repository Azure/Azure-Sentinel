name: Rare client observed with high reverse DNS lookup count - Static threshold based (ASIM DNS Solution)
description: |
  'This rule identifies clients with high reverse DNS counts, which could be carrying out reconnaissance or discovery activity. This helps in detecting the possible initial phases of an attack, like discovery and reconnaissance. It utilizes [ASIM](https://aka.ms/AboutASIM) normalization and is applied to any source that supports the ASIM DNS schema.'
