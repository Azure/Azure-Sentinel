	"Description": "Microsoft threat intelligence teams have been tracking multiple ransomware campaigns and have tied these attacks to DEV-0270, also known as Nemesis Kitten, a sub-group of Iranian actor PHOSPHORUS. Microsoft assesses with moderate confidence that DEV-0270 conducts malicious network operations, including widespread vulnerability scanning, on behalf of the government of Iran. For more technical and mitigation information, please read the [Microsoft Security blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/07/profiling-dev-0270-phosphorus-ransomware-operations/). As Microsoft continues to track DEV-0270â€™s tactics and techniques, we are also sharing guidance, detections and hunting queries to help our customers better defend against this threat through our security products.",
