    "Access to authenticated URL without credentials","This incident triggered because a vulnerable authenticated HANA URL was accessed without credentials. \n\nThe URI is vulnerable because it allows the corresponding (backend) SAP software component to be accessed without providing any credentials. This unauthenticated access provides an attacker with the privilege level of that functionality. The consequences will depend on the associated functionality, but they can range from reading or modifying sensitive data, access to administrative or other privileged functionality, or possibly even execution of arbitrary code.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Code Injection vulnerability in Visual Composer 04s iViews","This incident triggered because a URI vulnerable to code injection was accessed with malicious looking parameters. \n\nThe vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious code into the back-end application by sending a web request by means of a specially crafted URL. By fooling end users to access this URL, unwanted applications could potentially be started on the client machine by an attacker, resulting in remote code execution.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in backup function of SAP HANA cockpit","This incident triggered because a URI was accessed which is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. \n\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. \n\nAn attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user's browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Dangerous Report Execution","This incident triggered because a vulnerable report was executed. \n\nAn SAP report is an executable program that reads data from the database and generates output based on the filter criteria selected by the end user. \n\nThe fact that a vulnerable report was run may indicate, but not necessarily confirm, that an attacker is abusing the vulnerability.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Dangerous RFC Execution","This incident triggered because a vulnerable Remote Function Call (RFC) was executed. \n\nA Remote Function Call (RFC) is the call or remote execution of a Remote Function Module in an external system. In the SAP system, these functions are provided by the RFC interface system. The RFC interface system enables function calls between two SAP systems. Communication between applications of different systems in the SAP environment includes connections between SAP systems as well as between SAP systems and non-SAP systems. \n\nThe fact that a vulnerable RFC was performed may indicate, but not necessarily confirm, that an attacker is abusing a vulnerability.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Dangerous Transaction Execution","This incident triggered because a vulnerable transaction code was executed. \n\nEach function in the SAP system has a transaction code (t-code) associated with it. A transaction code consists of letters, numbers, or both. A transaction code is used to access functions or running programs in the SAP application more rapidly. By entering a t-code instead of using the menu, navigation and execution are combined into a single step. \n\nThe fact that a vulnerable transaction code was run may indicate, but not necessarily confirm, that an attacker is abusing the vulnerability.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Hardcoded Credential in Report","This incident triggered because a vulnerable report was called with a suspicious username. \n\nA report is a presentation of data in an organized structure. The report interface allows users to call reports from other SAP application components. \n\nIn this case the called report's program code contains a hard-coded credential. By calling the report with the hard-coded username, malicious users can be successfully authenticated and access parts of the systems not intended for them. \n\nThe fact that the report was called with a hard-coded username may indicate, but not necessarily confirm, that an attacker is abusing the vulnerability.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Host Header injection in SAP HANA","This incident triggered because an URI vulnerable to SQL injection was accessed. \n\nThe vulnerability concerns one of several vulnerabilities in the HANA User Self Service (USS) functionality. Through successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated attacker would be able to impersonate other users, even those of high privileged accounts. If exploited, these vulnerabilities allow an attacker, whether inside or outside the organization, to take full control of the SAP HANA platform remotely, without the need of a username and password. This level of access allows an attacker to take over business information and processes supported by HANA. This included creating, stealing, altering, and/or deleting sensitive information. If this risk is exploited, organizations may face severe business consequences. \n","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Information disclosure using the 'Download Snapshot' service of HANA cockpit for offline administration","This incident triggered because a vulnerable URI was accessed. \n\nBy accessing the URI in a specialized way, an attacker can discover information relating to the system. This information may be used by an attacker to specialize their attack and target security-relevant data. \n\nThe fact that a vulnerable URI was accessed may indicate, but not necessarily confirm, that an attacker is abusing the vulnerability.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "J2EE Invoker Servlet","This incident triggered because the Invoker Servlet was accessed. \n\nThe SAP Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE) Application Server has a wide set of built-in functionality, providing a comprehensive framework of libraries and services to support the development and deployment of Java applications. One of these functionalities is the Invoker Servlet, which is part of the standard J2EE specification of Sun (now Oracle). It was conceived as a rapid development instrument, allowing developers to test their custom Java applications very quickly. \n\nWhen enabled, this feature allows anyone to call specific applications without requiring authentication, which implies a security risk. The Invoker Servlet attack (sometimes referred to as the Invoker Servlet Detour) is the vulnerability caused by the previously mentioned feature and allows remote malicious hackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and perform unauthorized business activities via the vulnerable SAP applications. The potential impact of its exploitation is the complete compromise of the SAP system.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Missing XML Validation in Composite Application Framework Authorization Tool","This incident triggered because a vulnerable URI was accessed. \n\nThe vulnerable component which is accessed through the URI does not sufficiently validate an XML document coming from a possibly untrusted source. This programming error allows malicious users to submit XML files containing content that can cause harm to the system, for instance by disrupting service(s) or disclosing information that is is intended to remain private. \n\nThe fact that a vulnerable URI was accessed may indicate, but not necessarily confirm, that an attacker is abusing the vulnerability.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",

The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "OS Command Injection vulnerability in Report for Terminology Export","This incident triggered because a report vulnerable to OS command injection was accessed. \n\nThe system contains code that permits the execution of (possibly arbitrary) operating system commands of the user's choice. An attacker can therefore control the behavior of the system, or can potentially escalate privileges by executing malicious code, without having their own legitimate credentials.","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Path traversal using the 'Download Snapshot' service of HANA cockpit for offline administration", "This incident triggered because a URI was accessed which is vulnerable to directory traversal. \n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the insufficient validation of path information provided by users, thus characters representing 'traverse to parent directory' are passed through to the file access APIs. This allows a malicious user to potentially read, write and delete arbitrary files on the remote server, possibly disclosing confidential information, corrupting data or altering system behavior. \n","To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.",
    "Potential Directory Traversal in a UserAdmin Application","This incident triggered because a URI was accessed which is vulnerable to directory traversal. \n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the insufficient validation of path information provided by users, thus characters representing 'traverse to parent directory' are passed through to the file access APIs.
