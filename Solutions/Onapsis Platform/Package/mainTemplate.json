This unauthenticated access provides an attacker with the privilege level of that functionality. The consequences will depend on the associated functionality, but they can range from reading or modifying sensitive data, access to administrative or other privileged functionality, or possibly even execution of arbitrary code.\",\"To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced.

XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. \\n\\nAn attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user's browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.

The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.\",\n\"Dangerous RFC Execution\",\"This incident triggered because a vulnerable Remote Function Call (RFC) was executed. \\n\\nA Remote Function Call (RFC) is the call or remote execution of a Remote Function Module in an external system. In the SAP system, these functions are provided by the RFC interface system. The RFC interface system enables function calls between two SAP systems. Communication between applications of different systems in the SAP environment includes connections between SAP systems as well as between SAP systems and non-SAP systems. \\n\\nThe fact that a vulnerable RFC was performed may indicate, but not necessarily confirm, that an attacker is abusing a vulnerability.\",\"To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced. The note(s) will contain the prerequisites and instructions necessary to patch the system.\",\n\"Dangerous Transaction Execution\",\"This incident triggered because a vulnerable transaction code was executed. \\n\\nEach function in the SAP system has a transaction code (t-code) associated with it. A transaction code consists of letters, numbers, or both. A transaction code is used to access functions or running programs in the SAP application more rapidly. By entering a t-code instead of using the menu, navigation and execution are combined into a single step. \\n\\nThe fact that a vulnerable transaction code was run may indicate, but not necessarily confirm, that an attacker is abusing the vulnerability.\",\"To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced.

The report interface allows users to call reports from other SAP application components. \\n\\nIn this case the called report's program code contains a hard-coded credential. By calling the report with the hard-coded username, malicious users can be successfully authenticated and access parts of the systems not intended for them. \\n\\nThe fact that the report was called with a hard-coded username may indicate, but not necessarily confirm, that an attacker is abusing the vulnerability.\",\"To protect the system, please refer to the SAP note(s) referenced.

Through successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated attacker would be able to impersonate other users, even those of high privileged accounts. If exploited, these vulnerabilities allow an attacker, whether inside or outside the organization, to take full control of the SAP HANA platform remotely, without the need of a username and password. This level of access allows an attacker to take over business information and processes supported by HANA. This included creating, stealing, altering, and/or deleting sensitive information.

One of these functionalities is the Invoker Servlet, which is part of the standard J2EE specification of Sun (now Oracle). It was conceived as a rapid development instrument, allowing developers to test their custom Java applications very quickly. \\n\\nWhen enabled, this feature allows anyone to call specific applications without requiring authentication, which implies a security risk. The Invoker Servlet attack (sometimes referred to as the Invoker Servlet Detour) is the vulnerability caused by the previously mentioned feature and allows remote malicious hackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and perform unauthorized business activities via the vulnerable SAP applications.
