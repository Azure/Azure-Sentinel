Password spray attack against Azure AD application,"1. Use Cloud Authentication - In the cloud, we see billions of sign-ins to Microsoft systems every day. Our security detection algorithms allow us to detect and block attacks as they’re happening. Because these are real time detection and protection systems driven from the cloud, they are available only when doing Azure AD authentication in the cloud (including Pass-Through Authentication).","2.

Work with your Identity Global Admin and Enable MFA. A password is the key to accessing an account, but in a successful password spray attack, the attacker has guessed the correct password. To stop them, we need to use something more than just a password to distinguish between the account owner and the attacker. The three ways to do this are below:",4a. Risk-based MFA.,4b. Always-on MFA.,4c. Azure MFA as Primary Auth.,"5. NOTE: We strongly recommend enabling always-on multi-factor authentication for all admins in your organization, especially subscription owners and tenant admins. Seriously, go do this right now. For the best experience for the rest of your users, we recommend risk-based multi-factor authentication, which is available with Azure AD Premium P2 licenses. Otherwise, use Azure MFA for cloud authentication and ADFS. In ADFS, upgrade to ADFS on Windows Server 2016 to use Azure MFA as primary authentication, especially for all your extranet access.","6.
