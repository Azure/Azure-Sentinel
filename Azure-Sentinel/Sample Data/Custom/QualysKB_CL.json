    "Diagnosis": "&lt;DIV&gt; Issue Overview: \nA memory leakage flaw was found in the way the VNC display driver of QEMU handled the connection disconnect when ZRLE and Tight encoding are enabled. Two VncState objects are created, and one allocates memory for the Zlib's data object. This allocated memory is not freed upon disconnection, resulting in a memory leak. An attacker able to connect to the VNC server could use this flaw to leak host memory, leading to a potential denial of service. (CVE-2019-20382 )\nAn out-of-bounds read/write access flaw was found in the USB emulator of the QEMU. This issue occurs while processing USB packets from a guest when USBDevice 'setup_len' exceeds its 'data_buf[4096]' in the do_token_in, do_token_out routines. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service, or the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.

    "Diagnosis": "&lt;DIV&gt; Issue Overview: \nWhen importing a curve25519 private key in PKCS#8format with leading 0x00 bytes, it is possible to trigger an out-of-bounds read in the Network Security Services (NSS) library. This could lead to information disclosure. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR &lt; 60.8, Firefox &lt; 68, and Thunderbird &lt; 60.8. (CVE-2019-11719 )\nA vulnerability exists where it possible to force Network Security Services (NSS) to sign CertificateVerify with PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures when those are the only ones advertised by server in CertificateRequest in TLS 1.3. PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures should not be used for TLS 1.3 messages. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 68. (CVE-2019-11727 )\nA use-after-free flaw was found in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) related to PK11 session handling. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application compiled with NSS. (CVE-2019-11756 )\nA vulnerability was discovered in nss where input text length was not checked when using certain cryptographic primitives. This could lead to a heap-buffer overflow resulting in a crash and data leak. The highest threat is to confidentiality and integrity of data as well as system availability. (CVE-2019-17006 )\nA protocol downgrade flaw was found in Network Security Services (NSS). After a HelloRetryRequest has been sent, the client may negotiate a lower protocol than TLS 1.3, resulting in an invalid state transition in the TLS State Machine. If the client gets into this state, incoming Application Data records will be ignored. (CVE-2019-17023 )\nA side channel flaw was found in nss, in the way P-384 and P-521 curves are used in the generation of EDSA signatures, leaking partial information about the ECDSA nonce. Given a small number of ECDSA signatures, this information can be used to steal the private key. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. (CVE-2020-12400 )\nA flaw was found in nss. Using the EM side-channel, it is possible to extract the position of zero and non-zero wNAF digits while nss-certutil tool performs scalar multiplication during the ECDSA signature generation, leaking partial information about the ECDSA nonce. Given a small number of ECDSA signatures, this information can be used to steal the private key. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. (CVE-2020-12401 )\nA flaw was found in NSS, where it is vulnerable to RSA key generation cache timing side-channel attacks. An attacker with sufficient access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process could recover the private key. The highest threat to this flaw is to confidentiality. (CVE-2020-12402 )\nA flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS. When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads. This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20 (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and system availability. (&lt;/DIV&gt;",

    "Diagnosis": "&lt;DIV&gt; Issue Overview: \nIn binder_release_work of binder.c, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. (CVE-2020-0423 ) \nA flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Bluetooth implementation handled L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) packets with A2MP (Alternate MAC-PHY Manager Protocol) CID (Channel Identifier). This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to crash the system, causing a denial of service or potentially executing arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted L2CAP packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. (CVE-2020-12351 ) \nAn information leak flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack implementation handled initialization of stack memory when handling certain AMP (Alternate MAC-PHY Manager Protocol) packets. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to leak small portions of stack memory on the system by sending specially crafted AMP packets. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. (CVE-2020-12352 ) \nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Memory corruption can be exploited to gain root privileges from unprivileged processes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. (CVE-2020-14386 ) \nA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Bluetooth implementation processed extended advertising report events. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to crash the system, causing a denial of service or to potentially execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted Bluetooth packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2020-24490 ) \nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A local attacker, able to inject conntrack netlink configuration, could overflow a local buffer causing crashes or triggering the use of incorrect protocol numbers in ctnetlink_parse_tuple_filter in net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_netlink.c. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. (CVE-2020-25211 ) &lt;/DIV&gt;",
