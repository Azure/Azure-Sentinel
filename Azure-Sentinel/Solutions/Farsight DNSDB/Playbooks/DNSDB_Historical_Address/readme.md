# DNSDB_Historical_Address
author: Henry Stern, Farsight Security, Inc.

This playbook uses the Farsight DNSDB connector to automatically enrich Domain's found in the Sentinel incidents. This use case describes the desire to identify all Addresses used as DNS A records for a given Host based on a time window from a starting and stopping point in time. 
Learn more about the integration via the https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/farsightdnsdb/ or visit https://www.farsightsecurity.com/about-farsight-security/contacts/ to request a trial key.
