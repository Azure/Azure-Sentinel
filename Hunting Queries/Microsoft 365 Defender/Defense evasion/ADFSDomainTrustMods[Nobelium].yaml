description: |
  This query will find when federation trust settings are changed for a domain or when the domain is changed from managed to federated authentication. Results will relate to when a new Active Directory Federated Service (ADFS) TrustedRealm object, such as a signing certificate, is added.
  Modification to domain federation settings should be rare, so confirm the added or modified target domain/URL is legitimate administrative behavior.
  The actor, Nobelium, was observed modifying domain trust settings to subvert existing mechanisms and cause the domain to accept authorization tokens signed with actor-owned certificates. See Customer Guidance on Recent Nation-State Cyber Attacks.
  To understand why an authorized user may update settings for a federated domain in Office 365, Azure, or Intune, see Update or repair the settings of a federated domain in Office 365, Azure, or Intune.
  For details on security realms that accept security tokens, see the ADFS Proxy Protocol (MS-ADFSPP) specification: 3.2.5.1.2.4 Security Realm Data.
  For further information on AuditLogs, please see Microsoft Entra ID audit activity reference.
  This query is inspired by an Azure Sentinal detection.
