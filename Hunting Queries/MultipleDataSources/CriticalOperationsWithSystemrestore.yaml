name: Critical user management operations followed by disabling of System Restore from admin account
description: |
   'This query could identify critical user management operations like user registration(Microsoft Entra ID Multi-Factor Authentication & self-service password reset (SSPR)) authentication by admin account followed by attempts to stop System Restore activity. Stopping system restore prevents from recovering data by going back to a restore point. The operations could be an indication of attackers trying to maintain persistence, move laterally with attempts to stop system restore point that could point to a potential ransomware attack.'
