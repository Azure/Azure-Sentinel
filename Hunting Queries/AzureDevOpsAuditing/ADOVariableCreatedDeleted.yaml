name: Azure DevOps - Variable Created and Deleted
description: |
  'Variables can be used at various stages of a pipeline to inject static variables. Depending on the build process these variables could be added by an attacker to get a build process to conduct an unwanted action such as communicating with an attacker-controlled endpoint or injecting values into code. This query looks for variables that are added and then deleted in a short space of time. This is not normal expected behavior and could ben an indicator of attacker creating elements and then covering tracks. If this hunting query produces only a small number of events in an environment it could be promoted to a detection.'
