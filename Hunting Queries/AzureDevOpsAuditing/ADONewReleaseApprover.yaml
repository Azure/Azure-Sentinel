name: Azure DevOps - New Release Approver
description: |
  'Releases in Azure Pipelines often require a user authorization to perform the release. An attacker that has compromised a build may look to self-approve a release using a compromised account to avoid user focus on that release. This query looks for release approvers in pipelines where they have not approved a release in the last 30 days. This query can have a significant false positive rate so its best suited as a hunting query rather than a detection.'
