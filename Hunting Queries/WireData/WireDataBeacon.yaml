name: Detect beacon like pattern based on repetitive time intervals in Wire Data Traffic
description: |
  'Query identifies beaconing patterns from Wire Data logs. Uses KQL functions to calculate time delta and find beaconing percentage. Results of beaconing to untrusted public networks can be investigated.'
description_detailed: |
  'This query will identify beaconing patterns from Wire Data logs based on timedelta patterns. The query leverages various KQL functions
  to calculate time delta and then compare it with total events observed in a day to find percentage of beaconing.
  Results of such beaconing patterns to untrusted public networks can be a good starting point for investigation.

  between same source-destination pair.
