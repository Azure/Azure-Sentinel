name: Anomalous sign-in location by user account and authenticating application - with sign-in details
description: |
  'This query examines Microsoft Entra ID sign-ins and identifies anomalous changes in a user's location profile. A variation joins results back onto the original sign-in data to review the location set with each identified user in tabular form.'
description_detailed: |
  'This query over Microsoft Entra ID sign-in considers all user sign-ins for each Azure Active 
  Directory application and picks out the most anomalous change in location profile for a user within an 
  individual application. The intent is to hunt for user account compromise, possibly via a specific application
  vector.
  This variation of the query joins the results back onto the original sign-in data to allow review of the 
  location set with each identified user in tabular form.'
