name: Potential IIS brute force
description: |
  'This query shows when 1200 (20 per minute) or more failed attempts by cIP per hour occur on a given server and then a successful logon by cIP. 
  This only includes when more than 1 user agent strings is used or more than 1 port is used.
  This could be indicative of successful probing and password brute force success on your IIS servers. 
  Feel free to adjust the threshold as needed - ConnectionCount >= 1200
