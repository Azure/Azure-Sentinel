name: Same IP address with multiple csUserAgent
description: |
  'This alerts when the same client IP (cIP) is connecting with more than 1 but less than 15 different useragent string (csUserAgent) in less than 1 hour.
  We limit to 50 or less connections to avoid high traffic sites. This may indicate malicious activity as this is a method of probing an environment
