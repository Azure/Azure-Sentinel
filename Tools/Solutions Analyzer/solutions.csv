Dynatrace is a leading observability platform that provides automatic and intelligent observability at scale for cloud-native and enterprise workloads; with Dynatrace Application Security, your DevSecOps teams can resolve security issues faster, accelerating software delivery.
Integrating Dynatrace with Microsoft Sentinel enables DevSecOps teams to detect, prioritize, triage, and remediate attacks rapidly. DevSecOps teams benefit from the high-accuracy threat signals Dynatrace surfaces. It helps them avoid time-consuming investigation activities, freeing them up for more critical tasks.
Microsoft Sentinel data connectors poll Dynatrace for new [attacks, vulnerabilities, audit logs](https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/application-security/), and [problem events](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/davis-ai-landing).

**Included data connectors:**
- **Attacks**, Common attacks on application layer vulnerabilities which can be detected and blocked using Dynatrace, like SQL injection, command injection, and JNDI attacks.
- **Runtime vulnerabilities**, Software vulnerabilities detected throughout all layers of the application stack.
- **Audit logs**, Security-relevant events for a Dynatrace tenant.
- **Problems**, AI-powered observability problems raised across cloud and hybrid environments.

With that, it also introduces a concern around the risk of security vulnerabilities introduced by citizen developers, some of whom may lack the security awareness of traditional pro-dev community. To counter this, early threat detection is crucial and can complement preventative guardrails to enable frictionless productivity while minimizing cyber risk.

The Microsoft Sentinel solution for Microsoft Power Platform allows customers to monitor and detect various suspicious or malicious activities in their Power Platform environments.

It collects activity logs from the different Power Platform components (Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Platform Connectors, Power Platform DLP, Dataverse) as well as the Power Platform inventory data and analyzes those activity logs to detect threats and suspicious activities such as: Power Apps execution from unauthorized geographies, suspicious data destruction by Power Apps, mass deletion of Power Apps, phishing attacks made possible through Power Apps, Power Automate flows activity by departing employees, Microsoft Power Platform connectors added to the an environment, and the update or removal of Microsoft Power Platform data loss prevention policies.

Due to the integration of the Power Platform inventory data, in addition to the activity logs, the solution also allows customers to investigate the detected threats in a full human readable context and understand for example what the name of the suspicious app is, the name of Power Platform environment it belongs to, the details of the user who created or modified the suspicious app, the details of the users using the app, and more.

There are many ways organizations can utilize Recorded Future Identity Intelligence; the playbooks in this Solution are just a quick introduction to some of those ways. In particular, these playbooks include several actions that can be coordinated, or used separately. They include:
1. searches for compromised workforce or external customer users
2. looking up existing users and saving the compromised user data to a Log file
3. confirming high risk Entra ID users
4. adding a compromised user to an Entra ID security group
5. Updating Recorded Future Playbook Alerts

**Option 1 (Recommended)**: Bi-directional incident sync using app hosted on ServiceNow store. This option includes the following key features:

•		Retrieve Microsoft Sentinel incidents and automate the creation of incidents in ServiceNow.

•	Bi-directional sync of Status, Severity, Owner, Comments/Work notes, Entities and alerts.

•	Details of alerts and entities added to Work Notes, to improve analyst experience.

•	Filtering of Microsoft Sentinel incidents, based on tags or custom filters.

•	Support of multiple workspaces, with different incidents filters.

•	Support any incident  custom table, status or severity fields.

Please note that this option doesn't require installation of content hub solution and will need to be installed and managed from ServiceNow store. Refer to [ServiceNow Store](https://aka.ms/sentinel-servicenow-appstore) for details on how to use this option.

Installing this solution will deploy two data connectors,

Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/data-collection-syslog).
