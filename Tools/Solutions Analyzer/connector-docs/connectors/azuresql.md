Azure SQL is a fully managed, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) database engine that handles most database management functions, such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring, without necessitating user involvement. This connector lets you stream your Azure SQL databases audit and diagnostic logs into Microsoft Sentinel, allowing you to continuously monitor activity in all your instances.
