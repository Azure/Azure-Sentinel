The ForgeRock Identity Platform provides a single common auditing framework. Extract and aggregate log data across the entire platform with common audit (CAUD) event handlers and unique IDs so that it can be tracked holistically. Open and extensible, you can leverage audit logging and reporting capabilities for integration with Microsoft Sentinel via this CAUD for CEF connector.
