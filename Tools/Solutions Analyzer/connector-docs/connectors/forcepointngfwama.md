| **Connector ID** | `ForcepointNgfwAma` |
| **Publisher** | Forcepoint |
| **Tables Ingested** | [`CommonSecurityLog`](../tables-index.md#commonsecuritylog) |

The Forcepoint NGFW (Next Generation Firewall) connector allows you to automatically export user-defined Forcepoint NGFW logs into Microsoft Sentinel in real-time. This enriches visibility into user activities recorded by NGFW, enables further correlation with data from Azure workloads and other feeds, and improves monitoring capability with Workbooks inside Microsoft Sentinel.
