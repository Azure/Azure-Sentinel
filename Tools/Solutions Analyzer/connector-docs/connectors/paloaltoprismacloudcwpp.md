The [Palo Alto Prisma Cloud CWPP](https://prisma.pan.dev/api/cloud/cwpp/audits/#operation/get-audits-incidents) data connector allows you to connect to your Palo Alto Prisma Cloud CWPP instance and ingesting alerts into Microsoft Sentinel. The data connector is built on Microsoft Sentinel's Codeless Connector Platform and uses the Prisma Cloud API to fetch security events and supports DCR-based [ingestion time transformations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/custom-logs-overview) that parses the received security event data into a custom columns so that queries don't need to parse it again, thus resulting in better performance.
