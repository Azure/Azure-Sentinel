The CYFIRMA Compromised Accounts data connector enables seamless log ingestion from the DeCYFIR/DeTCT API into Microsoft Sentinel. Built on the Microsoft Sentinel Codeless Connector Platform, it leverages the DeCYFIR/DeTCT API to retrieve logs. Additionally, it supports DCR-based [ingestion time transformations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/custom-logs-overview), which parse security data into a custom table during ingestion. This eliminates the need for query-time parsing, enhancing performance and efficiency.
