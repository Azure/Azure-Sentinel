This connector gathers all events generated by ESET software through the central management solution ESET PROTECT (formerly ESET Security Management Center). This includes Anti-Virus detections, Firewall detections but also more advanced EDR detections. For a complete list of events please refer to [the documentation](https://help.eset.com/protect_admin/latest/en-US/events-exported-to-json-format.html).

## Setup Instructions

> ⚠️ **Note**: These instructions were automatically generated from the connector's user interface definition file using AI and may not be fully accurate. Please verify all configuration steps in the Microsoft Sentinel portal.

**NOTE:** This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected which is deployed as part of the solution. To view the function code in Log Analytics, open Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel Logs blade, click Functions and search for the alias ESETPROTECT and load the function code or click [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/ESETPROTECT/Parsers/ESETPROTECT.txt).The function usually takes 10-15 minutes to activate after solution installation/update.

**1. Install and onboard the agent for Linux**

Typically, you should install the agent on a different computer from the one on which the logs are generated.

>  Syslog logs are collected only from **Linux** agents.
**Choose where to install the agent:**

**Install agent on Azure Linux Virtual Machine**

  Select the machine to install the agent on and then click **Connect**.
  - **Install agent on Linux Virtual Machine**

  **Install agent on a non-Azure Linux Machine**

  Download the agent on the relevant machine and follow the instructions.
  - **Install agent on Linux (Non-Azure)**

**2. Configure the logs to be collected**

Configure the facilities you want to collect and their severities.

1.  Under workspace advanced settings **Configuration**, select **Data** and then **Syslog**.
2.  Select **Apply below configuration to my machines** and select the facilities and severities. The default ESET PROTECT facility is **user**.
3.  Click **Save**.
- **Open Syslog settings**

**3. Configure ESET PROTECT**

Configure ESET PROTECT to send all events through Syslog.

1.  Follow [these instructions](https://help.eset.com/protect_admin/latest/en-US/admin_server_settings_syslog.html) to configure syslog output. Make sure to select **BSD** as the format and **TCP** as the transport.

2.  Follow [these instructions](https://help.eset.com/protect_admin/latest/en-US/admin_server_settings_export_to_syslog.html) to export all logs to syslog. Select **JSON** as the output format.

Note:- Refer to the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-log-forwarder?tabs=rsyslog#security-considerations) for setting up the log forwarder for both local and cloud storage.
- **Open Syslog settings**
