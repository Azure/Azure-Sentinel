Connect to Azure DDoS Protection Standard logs via Public IP Address Diagnostic Logs. In addition to the core DDoS protection in the platform, Azure DDoS Protection Standard provides advanced DDoS mitigation capabilities against network attacks. It's automatically tuned to protect your specific Azure resources. Protection is simple to enable during the creation of new virtual networks. It can also be done after creation and requires no application or resource changes.
