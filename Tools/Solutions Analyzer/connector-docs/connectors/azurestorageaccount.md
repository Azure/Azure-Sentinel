Azure Storage account is a cloud solution for modern data storage scenarios. It contains all your data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. This connector lets you stream Azure Storage accounts diagnostics logs into your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, allowing you to continuously monitor activity in all your instances, and detect malicious activity in your organization.

## Setup Instructions

> ⚠️ **Note**: These instructions were automatically generated from the connector's user interface definition file using AI and may not be fully accurate. Please verify all configuration steps in the Microsoft Sentinel portal.

**1. Connect your Azure Storage Account diagnostics logs into Sentinel.**

This connector uses a set of Azure Policies to apply a log-streaming configuration to a collection of instances, defined as a scope. Follow the instructions below to create and apply policies to all current and future instances. To get most out of the Storage Account Diagnostic logging from the Azure Storage Account, we recommend that you enable Diagnostic logging from all services within the Azure Storage Account - Blob, Queue, Table and File. Note, you may already have an active policy for this resource type.
