Syslog is an event logging protocol that is common to Linux. Applications will send messages that may be stored on the local machine or delivered to a Syslog collector. When the Agent for Linux is installed, it configures the local Syslog daemon to forward messages to the agent. The agent then sends the message to the workspace.
