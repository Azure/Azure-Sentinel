# Microsoft Sentinel Data Connector Reference

This directory contains comprehensive reference for Microsoft Sentinel data connectors, organized by solutions, connectors, and tables.

## 📑 Documentation Structure

### Index Pages

- **[Solutions Index](solutions-index.md)** - Browse all solutions alphabetically, with overview statistics and quick access to solution details
- **[Connectors Index](connectors-index.md)** - Browse all unique connectors alphabetically, with publisher information, descriptions, and associated tables
- **[Tables Index](tables-index.md)** - Browse all unique tables alphabetically, with solution references and connector counts

### Solution Pages

Individual solution pages are organized in the [`solutions/`](solutions/) directory. Each solution page includes:

- Solution metadata (title, publisher, description)
- List of data connectors included in the solution
- Detailed connector information (ID, title, description)
- Tables associated with each connector
- Table uniqueness indicators (whether a table is used by only one connector)

## 📊 Quick Statistics

For current statistics, see the [Solutions Index](solutions-index.md) which displays up-to-date counts of solutions (with and without connectors), connectors, and tables.

## 🔍 How to Use This Documentation

### Find Information by Solution
Start at the [Solutions Index](solutions-index.md) to browse all available solutions alphabetically. Click on any solution name to view its detailed page with all connectors and tables.

### Find Information by Connector
Use the [Connectors Index](connectors-index.md) to find specific connectors. Each connector entry shows:
- Publisher name
- Full connector description
- Associated solution
- List of tables ingested by the connector

### Find Information by Table
Browse the [Tables Index](tables-index.md) to discover which solutions and connectors use a specific table. The index shows:
- All solutions that include connectors writing to the table
- Number of connectors using the table
- Whether the table is unique to a single connector

## 🔄 Navigation

All index pages include a navigation bar at the top for easy switching between different views:

```
Browse by:
- Solutions
- Connectors  
- Tables
```

Solution pages include a back link to return to the Solutions Index.

## 🛠️ Generation

This documentation is automatically generated from the Solutions Analyzer tool, which scans:
- Microsoft Sentinel solution packages
- Data connector definitions
- Parser files and KQL queries

The analyzer identifies table references in connector configurations and parser logic to create comprehensive mappings.

## 📝 Data Source

The documentation is based on analysis of the `solutions_connectors_tables_mapping.csv` file, which contains:
- Solution metadata
- Connector configurations
- Table mappings
- Detection methods
- Parser references
