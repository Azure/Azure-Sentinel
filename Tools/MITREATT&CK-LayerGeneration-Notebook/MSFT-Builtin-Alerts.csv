Atypical travel,"This risk detection type identifies two sign-ins originating from geographically distant locations, where at least one of the locations may also be atypical for the user, given past behavior. Among several other factors, this machine learning algorithm takes into account the time between the two sign-ins and the time it would have taken for the user to travel from the first location to the second, indicating that a different user is using the same credentials. The algorithm ignores obvious ""false positives"" contributing to the impossible travel conditions, such as VPNs and locations regularly used by other users in the organization. The system has an initial learning period of the earliest of 14 days or 10 logins, during which it learns a new user's sign-in behavior.",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC),https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks,AzureActiveDirectoryIdentityProtection,SecurityAlert (IPC)
Anomalous Token,"This detection indicates that there are abnormal characteristics in the token such as an unusual token lifetime or a token that is played from an unfamiliar location. This detection covers Session Tokens and Refresh Tokens. NOTE: Anomalous token is tuned to incur more noise than other detections at the same risk level. This tradeoff is chosen to increase the likelihood of detecting replayed tokens that may otherwise go unnoticed. Because this is a high noise detection, there is a higher than normal chance that some of the sessions flagged by this detection are false positives. We recommend investigating the sessions flagged by this detection in the context of other sign-ins from the user. If the location, application, IP address, User Agent, or other characteristics are unexpected for the user, the tenant admin should consider this as an indicator of potential token replay.",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC),https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks,AzureActiveDirectoryIdentityProtection,SecurityAlert (IPC)

This detection has been deprecated. Identity Protection will no longer generate new ""Malware linked IP address"" detections.

Unfamiliar sign-in properties,"This risk detection type considers past sign-in history (IP, Latitude / Longitude and ASN) to look for anomalous sign-ins. The system stores information about previous locations used by a user, and considers these ""familiar"" locations. The risk detection is triggered when the sign-in occurs from a location that is not already in the list of familiar locations. Newly created users will be in ""learning mode"" for a while where unfamiliar sign-in properties risk detections will be turned off while our algorithms learn the user's behavior. The learning mode duration is dynamic and depends on how much time it takes the algorithm to gather enough information about the user's sign-in patterns. The minimum duration is five days. A user can go back into learning mode after a long period of inactivity. The system also ignores sign-ins from familiar devices, and locations that are geographically close to a familiar location. We also run this detection for basic authentication (or legacy protocols). Because these protocols do not have modern properties such as client ID, there is limited telemetry to reduce false positives. We recommend our customers to move to modern authentication. Unfamiliar sign-in properties can be detected on both interactive and non-interactive sign-ins. When this detection is detected on non-interactive sign-ins, it deserves increased scrutiny due to the risk of token replay attacks.",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC),https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks,AzureActiveDirectoryIdentityProtection,SecurityAlert (IPC)
