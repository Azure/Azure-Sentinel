# Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management Sentinel Data Connector (Preview)
Author: Alex Anders

This custom data connector uses a Function App to pull Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) data from the M365 Defender API and ingests into the selected Log Analytics workspace via the Azure Monitor DCR API. Public NIST CVE information is also ingested to enrich the MDVM data. Six custom tables are created in the workspace:
- *MDVMCVEKB_CL* - MDVM CVE knowledge base.
- *MDVMNISTCVEKB_CL* - NIST CVE knowledge base
- *MDVMNISTConfigurations_CL* - NIST CVE knowledge base: known vulnerable software configurations.
- *MDVMRecommendations_CL* - MDVM recommendations.
- *MDVMSecureConfigurationsByDevice_CL* - Secure configuration assessment details for each device.
- *MDVMVulnerabilitiesByDevice_CL* - Vulnerability assessment details for each device.


## **Pre-requisites**
1. An Azure Subscription
2. An Azure Sentinel/Log Analytics workspace
3. Permissions required to deploy resources:
    - Owner permissions on the target resource group.
    - Log Analytics Contributor or higher permissions on the destination Log Analytics workspace.
4. Permissions required for assigning the needed permissions post deployment:
    - Global Admin or Application Administrator privileges on Defender Azure AD tenant. This is to give the solution access to the Defender API.
    - Owner or User Access Administrator access to subscriptions containing Virtual Machines or Arc Server resources. This is to provide the solution reader access.

## **Deployment Process**
## 1. Deploy Azure Resources
1. Click the appropriate **Deploy to Azure** button below.
2. Once in the Azure Portal, select the **Subscription** and **Resource Group** to deploy the resources into.
3. Populate the required **Log Analytics Workspace ID** and **Location** parameters. Modify the default parameters as needed but most users can leave these alone.
4. Click **Review and Create**.
5. Click **Create**.
6. When the deployment has completed, grab the UserAssignedManagedIdentityPrincipalId and UserAssignedManagedIdentityPrincipalName values from the deployment Outputs section. These will be used in the next step.

## 2. Assign Needed Permissions
After the resources have been deployed, we need to assign the appropriate M365 Defender API and Azure permissions to the newly created User Assigned Managed Identity by doing the following:
1. From a PowerShell prompt, connect to Azure via [Connect-AzAccount -TenantId [The Tenant ID your Defender instance resides in.]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount?view=azps-9.2.0) with an account that has the Global Admin or Application Administrator role assigned. Then, run the following PowerShell commands:
```PowerShell
#UserAssignedManagedIdentityPrincipalId value Copied from step 1.6 above. INSERT THE VALUE BETWEEN THE SINGLE QUOTES BELOW.
$managedIdentityPrincipalId = '' 
$permissions = "SecurityRecommendation.Read.All", "Vulnerability.Read.All"

#Lookup Resource and App Roles (permissions).
$resource =  Get-AzADServicePrincipal -Filter "DisplayName eq 'WindowsDefenderATP'"
$appRoles = $resource.AppRole | Where-Object Value -in $permissions

#Assign App Roles to Managed Identity.
foreach ($appRole in $appRoles) {
    $body = @{
        principalId = $ManagedIdentityPrincipalId
        resourceId = $resource.Id
        appRoleId = $appRole.id
    }
    (Invoke-AzRestMethod -Method POST -Uri ("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/" + $resource.Id + "/appRoleAssignedTo") -Payload (ConvertTo-Json $body)).Content | ConvertFrom-Json
}
```
2. Assign the User Assigned Managed Identity Reader access to all management groups/subscriptions that contain Virtual Machine or Arc Server resources. Do this by: 
    1. Navigate to the appropriate management group/subscription in the Azure portal.
    2. Select the **Access Control (IAM)** menu.
    3. Select **Add** => **Add Role Assignment**.
    4. Select the **Reader** Role and click Next.
    5. Select **Managed Identity**, Select **Members**, and search for the **User Assigned Managed Identity** created during the deployment. The name was capture in step 6 above.
    6. Click Next, then Review and Assign.

### Non-Network Restricted Deployment
No virtual network or Private Endpoints are deployed and public network access to the Function App and Storage Account is unrestricted. The Key Vault is restricted to only allow access from Function App public IP addresses. Use this for test environments or if you prefer to implement network restrictions yourself after deployment.

### Network Restricted Deployment
Function App public access is restricted and a virtual network along with the appropriate Private DNS Zones are created to provide out of the box Private Endpoint connectivity between the Function App and its dependencies (Key Vault and Storage Account).

### Workbook Deployment
A modified version of the Defender for Cloud "Vulnerability Assessment Findings" workbook to include the MDVM data collected by this connector.
