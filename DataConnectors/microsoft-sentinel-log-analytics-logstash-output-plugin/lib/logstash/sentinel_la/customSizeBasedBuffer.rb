  # This code is from a PR for the official repo of ruby-stud
  # with a small change to calculating the event size in the var_size function
  # https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-stud/pull/19
  #
  # @author {Alex Dean}[http://github.com/alexdean]
  #
  # Implements a generic framework for accepting events which are later flushed
  # in batches. Flushing occurs whenever +:max_items+ or +:max_interval+ (seconds)
  # has been reached or if the event size outgrows +:flush_each+ (bytes)
  #
  # Including class must implement +flush+, which will be called with all
  # accumulated items either when the output buffer fills (+:max_items+ or
  # +:flush_each+) or when a fixed amount of time (+:max_interval+) passes.
  #
  # == batch_receive and flush
  # General receive/flush can be implemented in one of two ways.
  #
  # === batch_receive(event) / flush(events)
  # +flush+ will receive an array of events which were passed to +buffer_receive+.
  #
  #   batch_receive('one')
  #   batch_receive('two')
  #
  # will cause a flush invocation like
  #
  #   flush(['one', 'two'])
  #
  # === batch_receive(event, group) / flush(events, group)
  # flush() will receive an array of events, plus a grouping key.
  #
  #   batch_receive('one',   :server => 'a')
  #   batch_receive('two',   :server => 'b')
  #   batch_receive('three', :server => 'a')
  #   batch_receive('four',  :server => 'b')
  #
  # will result in the following flush calls
  #
  #   flush(['one', 'three'], {:server => 'a'})
  #   flush(['two', 'four'],  {:server => 'b'})
  #
  # Grouping keys can be anything which are valid Hash keys. (They don't have to
  # be hashes themselves.) Strings or Fixnums work fine. Use anything which you'd
  # like to receive in your +flush+ method to help enable different handling for
  # various groups of events.
  #
  # == on_flush_error
  # Including class may implement +on_flush_error+, which will be called with an
  # Exception instance whenever buffer_flush encounters an error.
  #
  # * +buffer_flush+ will automatically re-try failed flushes, so +on_flush_error+
  #   should not try to implement retry behavior.
  # * Exceptions occurring within +on_flush_error+ are not handled by
  #   +buffer_flush+.
  #
  # == on_full_buffer_receive
  # Including class may implement +on_full_buffer_receive+, which will be called
  # whenever +buffer_receive+ is called while the buffer is full.
  #
  # +on_full_buffer_receive+ will receive a Hash like <code>{:pending => 30,
  # :outgoing => 20}</code> which describes the internal state of the module at
  # the moment.
  #
  # == final flush
  # Including class should call <code>buffer_flush(:final => true)</code>
  # during a teardown/shutdown routine (after the last call to buffer_receive)
  # to ensure that all accumulated messages are flushed.
