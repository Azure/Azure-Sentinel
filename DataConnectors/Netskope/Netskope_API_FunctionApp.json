If the time interval needs to be modified, it is recommended to change the Function App Timer Trigger accordingly (in the function.json file, post deployment) to prevent overlapping data ingestion.\n - The default **Log Types** is set to pull all 6 available log types (`alert, page, application, audit, infrastructure, network`), remove any are not required. \n - Note: If using Azure Key Vault secrets for any of the values above, use the`@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri={Security Identifier})`schema in place of the string values.
