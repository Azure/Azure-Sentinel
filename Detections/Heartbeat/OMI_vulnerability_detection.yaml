  Following the September 14th, 2021 release of three Elevation of Privilege
  (EoP) vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-38645, CVE-2021-38649, CVE-2021-38648) and one
  unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2021-38647) in
  the Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) Framework.
  This detection validates that any OMS-agent that is reporting to the Microsoft
  Sentinel workspace is updated with the patch. The detection will go over the
  heartbeats received from all agents over the last day and will create alert
  for those agents who are not updated.
