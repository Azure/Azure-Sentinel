name: Azure DevOps - PAT used with Browser.
description: |
  'Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are used as an alternate password to authenticate into Azure DevOps. PATs are intended for programmatic access for use in code or applications. Given this they can be prone to attacker theft if not adequately secured. This queries looks for the use of a PAT in authentication but from a User Agent indicating a browser. This should not be normal activity and could be an indicator of an attacker using a stolen PAT.'
