name: IP with multiple failed Azure AD logins successfully logs in to Palo Alto VPN
description: |
    This query creates a list of IP addresses with a number failed login attempts to AAD 
    above a set threshold.  It then looks for any successful Palo Alto VPN logins from any
    of these IPs within the same timeframe.
