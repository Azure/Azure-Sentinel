name: IP with multiple failed Microsoft Entra ID logins successfully logs in to Palo Alto VPN
description: |
    This query creates a list of IP addresses with the number of failed login attempts to Entra ID 
    above a set threshold ( default of 5 ).  It then looks for any successful Palo Alto VPN logins from any of these IPs within the same timeframe.
