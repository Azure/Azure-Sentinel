name: Anomalous sign-in location by user account and authenticating application
description: |
  'This query over Azure Active Directory sign-in considers all user sign-ins for each Azure Active 
  Directory application and picks out the most anomalous change in location profile for a user within an 
  individual application. An alert is generated for recent sign-ins that have location counts that are anomalous
  over last day but also over the last 3-day and 7-day periods.
  Please note that on workspaces with larger volume of Signin data (~10M+ events a day) may timeout when using this default query time period.
  It is recommended that you test and tune this appropriately for the workspace.'
