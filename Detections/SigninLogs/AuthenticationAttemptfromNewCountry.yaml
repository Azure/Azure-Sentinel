name: Authentication Attempt from New Country
description: |
  Detects when there is a login attempt from a country that has not seen a successful login in the previous 14 days.
  Threat actors may attempt to authenticate with credentials from compromised accounts - monitoring attempts from anomalous locations may help identify these attempts.
  Authentication attempts should be investigated to ensure the activity was legitimate and if there is other similar activity.
