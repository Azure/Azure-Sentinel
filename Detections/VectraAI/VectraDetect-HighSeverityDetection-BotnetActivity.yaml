name: Vectra AI Detect - Botnet Activity Detection with High Severity
description: |
  'Identifies detections with a threat score superior to 7.0 in the category Botnet Activity. This is consider has a high severity alert and should be investigated. 
  The Severity is a mapping with the Threat score assigned to a detection. It ranges between 0 and 10. 
  The severity_threshold can be adjusted as desired.'
