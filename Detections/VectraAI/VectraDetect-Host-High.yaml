name: Vectra AI Detect - Host in the High Quadrant
description: |
  'Identifies multiple Detections coming from the same internal Host which caused a move into Detect's High quadrant. 
  To meet this requirement, the threat score must be in 50-100 range and the certainty score in the 0-50 range (range is 1-100 for threat and certainty). If required, variables in the query can be adjusted to a different threshold. '
